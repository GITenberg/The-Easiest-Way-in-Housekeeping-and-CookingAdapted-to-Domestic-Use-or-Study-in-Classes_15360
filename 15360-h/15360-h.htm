<h2>PREFACE TO REVISED EDITION.</h2>


<p>The little book now revised and sent out with some
slight additions, remains substantially the same as
when first issued in 1880. In the midst of always increasing
cookery-books, it has had a firm constituency of
friends, especially in the South, where its necessity was
first made plain. To enlarge it in any marked degree
would violate the original plan, for which the critic will
please read the pages headed &quot;Introductory,&quot; where he
or she will find full explanation of the growth and
purpose of the book. Whoever desires more receipts
and more elaborate forms of preparation must look for
their sources in the bibliography at the end, since their
introduction in these pages would practically nullify the
title, proved true by years of testing at the hands of
inexperienced housekeepers, whose warm words have
long been very pleasant to the author of &quot;The Easiest
Way.&quot;</p>

<p>That room or toleration for another &quot;cook-book&quot; can
exist in the public mind, will be denied at once, with
all the vigor to be expected from a people overrun with
cook-books, and only anxious to relegate the majority of
them to their proper place as trunk-linings and kindling-material.
The minority, admirable in plan and execution,
and elaborate enough to serve all republican purposes, are
surely sufficient for all the needs that have been or may
be. With Mrs. Cornelius and Miss Parloa, Marion Harland
and Mrs. Whitney, and innumerable other trustworthy
authorities, for all every-day purposes, and Mrs.
Henderson for such festivity as we may at times desire to
make, another word is not only superfluous but absurd; in
fact, an outrage on common sense, not for one instant to
be justified.</p>

<p>Such was my own attitude and such my language hardly
a year ago; yet that short space of time has shown me,
that, whether the public admit the claim, or no, one more
cook-book MUST BE. And this is why:&mdash;</p>

<p>A year of somewhat exceptional experience&mdash;that involved
in building up several cooking-schools in a new
<a name="Page_6" id="Page_6"></a>locality, demanding the most thorough and minute system
to assure their success and permanence&mdash;showed the inadequacies
of any existing hand-books, and the necessities
to be met in making a new one. Thus the present book
has a twofold character, and represents, not only the ordinary
receipt or cook book, usable in any part of the country
and covering all ordinary household needs, but covers
the questions naturally arising in every lesson given, and
ending in statements of the most necessary points in household
science. There are large books designed to cover
this ground, and excellent of their kind, but so cumbrous
in form and execution as to daunt the average reader.</p>

<p>Miss Corson's &quot;Cooking-School Text-Book&quot; commended
itself for its admirable plainness and fullness of
detail, but was almost at once found impracticable as a
system for my purposes; her dishes usually requiring the
choicest that the best city market could afford, and taking
for granted also a taste for French flavorings not yet common
outside of our large cities, and to no great extent
within them. To utilize to the best advantage the food-resources
of whatever spot one might be in, to give information
on a hundred points suggested by each lesson, yet
having no place in the ordinary cook-book, in short, <i>to teach
household science as well as cooking</i>, became my year's
work; and it is that year's work which is incorporated in
these pages. Beginning with Raleigh, N.C., and lessons
given in a large school there, it included also a seven-months'
course at the Deaf and Dumb Institute, and regular
classes for ladies. Straight through, in those classes, it
became my business to say, &quot;This is no infallible system,
warranted to give the whole art of cooking in twelve lessons.
All I can do for you is to lay down clearly certain fixed
<a name="Page_7" id="Page_7"></a>principles; to show you how to economize thoroughly, yet
get a better result than by the expenditure of perhaps much
more material. Before our course ends, you will have had
performed before you every essential operation in cooking,
and will know, so far as I can make you know, prices,
qualities, constituents, and physiological effects of every
type of food. Beyond this, the work lies in your own
hands.&quot;</p>

<p>Armed with manuals,&mdash;American, English, French,&mdash;bent
upon systematizing the subject, yet finding none
entirely adequate, gradually, and in spite of all effort to
the contrary, I found that my teaching rested more and
more on my own personal experience as a housekeeper,
both at the South and at the North. The mass of material
in many books was found confusing and paralyzing,
choice seeming impossible when a dozen methods were
given. And for the large proportion of receipts, directions
were so vague that only a trained housekeeper
could be certain of the order of combination, or results
when combined. So from the crowd of authorities was
gradually eliminated a foundation for work; and on that
foundation has risen a structure designed to serve two
ends.</p>

<p>For the young housekeeper, beginning with little or no
knowledge, but eager to do and know the right thing, not
alone for kitchen but for the home as a whole, the list
of topics touched upon in Part I. became essential.
That much of the knowledge compressed there should
have been gained at home, is at once admitted: but, unfortunately,
few homes give it; and the aim has been to
cover the ground concisely yet clearly and attractively.
As to Part II., it does not profess to be the whole
<a name="Page_8" id="Page_8"></a>art of cooking, but merely the line of receipts most
needed in the average family, North or South. Each receipt
has been tested personally by the writer, often many
times; and each one is given so minutely that failure is
well-nigh impossible, if the directions are intelligently followed.
A few distinctively Southern dishes are included,
but the ground covered has drawn from all sources; the
series of excellent and elaborate manuals by well-known
authors having contributed here and there, but the majority
of rules being, as before said, the result of years of
personal experiment, or drawn from old family receipt-books.</p>

<p>To facilitate the work of the teacher, however, a scheme
of lessons is given at the end, covering all that can well
be taught in the ordinary school year: each lesson is given
with page references to the receipts employed, while a
shorter and more compact course is outlined for the use
of classes for ladies. A list of topics is also given for
school use; it having been found to add greatly to the interest
of the course to write each week the story of some
ingredient in the lesson for the day, while a set of questions,
to be used at periodical intervals, fixes details, and
insures a certain knowledge of what progress has been
made. The course covers the chemistry and physiology
of food, as well as an outline of household science in general,
and may serve as a text-book wherever such study
is introduced. It is hoped that this presentation of the
subject will lessen the labor necessary in this new field,
though no text-book can fully take the place of personal
enthusiastic work.</p>

<p>That training is imperatively demanded for rich and
poor alike, is now unquestioned; but the mere taking a
<a name="Page_9" id="Page_9"></a>course of cooking-lessons alone does not meet the need
in full. The present book aims to fill a place hitherto unoccupied;
and precisely the line of work indicated there
has been found the only practical method in a year's
successful organization of schools at various points.
Whether used at home with growing girls, in cooking-clubs,
in schools, or in private classes, it is hoped that
the system outlined and the authorities referred to will
stimulate interest, and open up a new field of work to
many who have doubted if the food question had any interest
beyond the day's need, and who have failed to see
that nothing ministering to the best life and thought of
this wonderful human body could ever by any chance be
rightfully called &quot;common or unclean.&quot; We are but on
the threshold of the new science. If these pages make
the way even a little plainer, the author will have accomplished
her full purpose, and will know that in spite of
appearances there is &quot;room for one more.&quot;</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I" />CHAPTER I.</h2>

<h2>THE HOUSE: SITUATION AND ARRANGEMENT.</h2>


<p>From the beginning it must be understood that what is
written here applies chiefly to country homes. The
general principles laid down are applicable with equal
force to town or city life; but as a people we dwell mostly
in the country, and, even in villages or small towns, each
house is likely to have its own portion of land about it,
and to look toward all points of the compass, instead of
being limited to two, as in city blocks. Of the comparative
advantages or disadvantages of city or country life,
there is no need to speak here. Our business is simply
to give such details as may apply to both, but chiefly to
the owners of moderate incomes, or salaried people, whose
expenditure must always be somewhat limited. With the
exterior of such homes, women at present have very little
to do; and the interior also is thus far much in the hands
of architects, who decide for general prettiness of effect,
rather than for the most convenient arrangement of space.
The young bride, planning a home, is resolved upon a bay-window,
as large a parlor as possible, and an effective
spare-room; but, having in most cases no personal knowl<a name="Page_12" id="Page_12"></a>edge
of work, does not consider whether kitchen and dining-room
are conveniently planned, or not, and whether
the arrangement of pantries and closets is such that both
rooms must be crossed a hundred times a day, when a
little foresight might have reduced the number certainly
by one-half, perhaps more.</p>

<p>Inconvenience can, in most cases, be remedied; but unhealthfulness
or unwholesomeness of location, very seldom:
and therefore, in the beginning, I write that ignorance
is small excuse for error, and that every one able to
read at all, or use common-sense about any detail of life,
is able to form a judgment of what is healthful or unhealthful.
If no books are at hand, consult the best
physician near, and have his verdict as to the character of
the spot in which more or less of your life in this world
will be spent, and which has the power to affect not only
your mental and bodily health, but that of your children.
Because your fathers and mothers have been neglectful of
these considerations, is no reason why you should continue
in ignorance; and the first duty in making a home is to
consider earnestly and intelligently certain points.</p>

<p>Four essentials are to be thought of in the choice of
any home; and their neglect, and the ignorance which is
the foundation of this neglect, are the secret of not only
the chronic ill-health supposed to be a necessity of the
American organization, but of many of the epidemics and
mysterious diseases classed under the head of &quot;visitations
of Providence.&quot;</p>

<p>These essentials are: a wholesome situation, good ventilation,
good drainage, and a dry cellar. Rich or poor,
high or low, if one of these be disregarded, the result will
tell, either on your own health or on that of your fam<a name="Page_13" id="Page_13"></a>ily.
Whether palace or hut, brown-stone front or simple
wooden cottage, the law is the same. As a rule, the
ordinary town or village is built upon low land, because it
is easier to obtain a water-supply from wells and springs.
In such a case, even where the climate itself may be
tolerably healthy, the drainage from the hills at hand, or
the nearness of swamps and marshes produced by the
same cause, makes a dry cellar an impossibility; and this
shut-in and poisonous moisture makes malaria inevitable.
The dwellers on low lands are the pill and patent-medicine
takers; and no civilized country swallows the amount
of tonics and bitters consumed by our own.</p>

<p>If possible, let the house be on a hill, or at least a rise
of ground, to secure the thorough draining-away of all
sewage and waste water. Even in a swampy and malarious
country, such a location will insure all the health
possible in such a region, if the other conditions mentioned
are faithfully attended to.</p>

<p>Let the living-rooms and bedrooms, as far as may be,
have full sunshine during a part of each day; and reserve
the north side of the house for store-rooms, refrigerator,
and the rooms seldom occupied. Do not allow trees to
stand so near as to shut out air or sunlight; but see that,
while near enough for beauty and for shade, they do not
constantly shed moisture, and make twilight in your
rooms even at mid-day. Sunshine is the enemy of disease,
which thrives in darkness and shadow. Consumption
or scrofulous disease is almost inevitable in the house
shut in by trees, whose blinds are tightly closed lest some
ray of sunshine fade the carpets; and over and over again
it has been proved that the first conditions of health are,
abundant supply of pure air, and free admission of sun<a name="Page_14" id="Page_14"></a>light
to every nook and cranny. Even with imperfect or
improper food, these two allies are strong enough to carry
the day for health; and, when the three work in harmony,
the best life is at once assured.</p>

<p>If the house must be on the lowlands, seek a sandy or
gravelly soil; and avoid those built over clay beds, or
even where clay bottom is found under the sand or loam.
In the last case, if drainage is understood, pipes may be
so arranged as to secure against any standing water; but,
unless this is done, the clammy moisture on walls, and
the chill in every closed room, are sufficient indication
that the conditions for disease are ripe or ripening. The
only course in such case, after seeking proper drainage,
is, first, abundant sunlight, and, second, open fires, which
will act not only as drying agents, but as ventilators and
purifiers. Aim to have at least one open fire in the
house. It is not an extravagance, but an essential, and
economy may better come in at some other place.</p>

<p>Having settled these points as far as possible,&mdash;the
question of water-supply and ventilation being left to
another chapter,&mdash;it is to be remembered that the house
is not merely a place to be made pleasant for one's friends.
They form only a small portion of the daily life; and the
first consideration should be: Is it so planned that the
necessary and inevitable work of the day can be accomplished
with the least expenditure of force? North and
South, the kitchen is often the least-considered room of
the house; and, so long as the necessary meals are served
up, the difficulties that may have hedged about such serving
are never counted. At the South it is doubly so, and
necessarily; old conditions having made much consideration
of convenience for servants an unthought-of thing.<a name="Page_15" id="Page_15"></a>
With a throng of unemployed women and children, the
question could only be, how to secure some small portion
of work for each one; and in such case, the greater the
inconveniences, the more chance for such employment.
Water could well be half a mile distant, when a dozen
little darkies had nothing to do but form a running line
between house and spring; and so with wood and kindling
and all household necessities.</p>

<p>To-day, with the old service done away with once for
all, and with a set of new conditions governing every
form of work, the Southern woman faces difficulties to
which her Northern or Western sister is an utter stranger;
faces them often with a patience and dignity beyond all
praise, but still with a hopelessness of better things, the
necessary fruit of ignorance. Old things are passed
away, and the new order is yet too unfamiliar for rules to
have formulated and settled in any routine of action.
While there is, at the North, more intuitive and inherited
sense of how things should be done, there is on many
points an almost equal ignorance, more especially among
the cultivated classes, who, more than at any period of
woman's history, are at the mercy of their servants.
Every science is learned but domestic science. The
schools ignore it; and, indeed, in the rush toward an
early graduation, there is small room for it.</p>

<p>&quot;She can learn at home,&quot; say the mothers. &quot;She
will take to it when her time comes, just as a duck takes
to water,&quot; add the fathers; and the matter is thus dismissed
as settled.</p>

<p>In the mean time the &quot;she&quot; referred to&mdash;the average
daughter of average parents in both city and country&mdash;neither
&quot;learns at home,&quot; nor &quot;takes to it naturally,&quot;<a name="Page_16" id="Page_16"></a>
save in exceptional cases; and the reason for this is found
in the love, which, like much of the love given, is really
only a higher form of selfishness. The busy mother of a
family, who has fought her own way to fairly successful
administration, longs to spare her daughters the petty
cares, the anxious planning, that have helped to eat out
her own youth; and so the young girl enters married life
with a vague sense of the dinners that must be, and a
general belief that somehow or other they come of themselves.
And so with all household labor. That to perform
it successfully and skillfully, demands not only training,
but the best powers one can bring to bear upon its
accomplishment, seldom enters the mind; and the student,
who has ended her course of chemistry or physiology
enthusiastically, never dreams of applying either to every-day
life.</p>

<p>This may seem a digression; and yet, in the very outset,
it is necessary to place this work upon the right footing,
and to impress with all possible earnestness the fact, that
Household Science holds every other science in tribute,
and that only that home which starts with this admission
and builds upon the best foundation the best that thought
can furnish, has any right to the name of &quot;home.&quot; The
swarms of drunkards, of idiots, of insane, of deaf and
dumb, owe their existence to an ignorance of the laws of
right living, which is simply criminal, and for which we
must be judged; and no word can be too earnest, which
opens the young girl's eyes to the fact that in her hands
lie not alone her own or her husband's future, but the
future of the nation. It is hard to see beyond one's own
circle; but if light is sought for, and there is steady
resolve and patient effort to do the best for one's individ<a name="Page_17" id="Page_17"></a>ual
self, and those nearest one, it will be found that the
shadow passes, and that progress is an appreciable thing.</p>

<p>Begin in your own home. Study to make it not only
beautiful, but perfectly appointed. If your own hands
must do the work, learn every method of economizing
time and strength. If you have servants, whether one or
more, let the same laws rule. It is not easy, I admit;
no good thing is: but there is infinite reward for every
effort. Let no failure discourage, but let each one be only
a fresh round in the ladder all must climb who would do
worthy work; and be sure that the end will reward all
pain, all self-sacrifice, and make you truly the mistresses
of the home for which every woman naturally and rightfully
hopes, but which is never truly hers till every shade
of detail in its administration has been mastered.</p>

<p>The house, then, is the first element of home to be considered
and studied; and we have settled certain points
as to location and arrangement. This is no hand-book
of plans for houses, that ground being thoroughly covered
in various books,&mdash;the titles of two or three of
which are given in a list of reference-books at the end.
But, whether you build or buy, see to it that your kitchens
and working-rooms are well lighted, well aired, and of
good size, and that in the arrangement of the kitchen
especially, the utmost convenience becomes the chief end.
Let sink, pantries, stove or range, and working-space for
all operations in cooking, be close at hand. The difference
between a pantry at the opposite end of the room,
and one opening close to the sink, for instance, may seem
a small matter; but when it comes to walking across the
room with every dish that is washed, the steps soon count
up as miles, and in making even a loaf of bread, the time
<a name="Page_18" id="Page_18"></a>and strength expended in gathering materials together
would go far toward the thorough kneading, which, when
added to the previous exertion, makes the whole operation,
which might have been only a pleasure, a burden
and an annoyance.</p>

<p>Let, then, stove, fuel, water, work-table, and pantries
be at the same end of the kitchen, and within a few steps
of one another, and it will be found that while the general
labor of each day must always be the same, the time required
for its accomplishment will be far less, under these
favorable conditions. The successful workman,&mdash;the
type-setter, the cabinet-maker, or carpenter,&mdash;whose art
lies in the rapid combination of materials, arranges his
materials and tools so as to be used with the fewest possible
movements; and the difference between a skilled and
unskilled workman is not so much the rate of speed in
movement, as in the ability to make each motion tell.
The kitchen is the housekeeper's workshop; and, in the
chapter on <i>House-work</i>, some further details as to methods
and arrangements will be given.</p>

<h2>THE HOUSE: VENTILATION.</h2>


<p>Having settled the four requisites in any home, and
suggested the points to be made in regard to the
first one,&mdash;that of wholesome situation,&mdash;<i>Ventilation</i> is
next in order. Theoretically, each one of us who has
studied either natural philosophy or physiology will state
at once, with more or less glibness, the facts as to the
atmosphere, its qualities, and the amount of air needed
by each individual; practically nullifying such statement
by going to bed in a room with closed windows and doors,
or sitting calmly in church or public hall, breathing over
and over again the air ejected from the lungs all about,&mdash;practice
as cleanly and wholesome as partaking of food
chewed over and over by an indiscriminate crowd.</p>

<p>Now, as to find the Reason Why of all statements and
operations is our first consideration, the familiar ground
must be traversed again, and the properties and constituents
of air find place here. It is an old story, and, like
other old stories accepted by the multitude, has become
almost of no effect; passive acceptance mentally, absolute
rejection physically, seeming to be the portion of much of
the gospel of health. &quot;Cleanliness is next to godliness,&quot;
is almost an axiom. I am disposed to amend it, and
assert that cleanliness <i>is</i> godliness, or a form of godliness.<a name="Page_20" id="Page_20"></a>
At any rate, the man or woman who demands cleanliness
without and within, this cleanliness meaning pure
air, pure water, pure food, must of necessity have a
stronger body and therefore a clearer mind (both being
nearer what God meant for body and mind) than the one
who has cared little for law, and so lived oblivious to the
consequences of breaking it.</p>

<p>Ventilation, seemingly the simplest and easiest of
things to be accomplished, has thus far apparently defied
architects and engineers. Congress has spent a million
in trying to give fresh air to the Senate and Representative
Chambers, and will probably spend another before
that is accomplished. In capitols, churches, and public
halls of every sort, the same story holds. Women faint,
men in courts of justice fall in apoplectic fits, or become
victims of new and mysterious diseases, simply from the
want of pure air. A constant slow murder goes on in
nurseries and schoolrooms; and white-faced, nerveless
children grow into white-faced and nerveless men and
women, as the price of this violated law.</p>

<p>What is this air, seemingly so hard to secure, so hard
to hold as part of our daily life, without which we can not
live, and which we yet contentedly poison nine times out
of ten?</p>

<p>Oxygen, nitrogen, carbonic acid, and watery vapor; the
last two being a small portion of the bulk, oxygen and
nitrogen making up four-fifths. Small as the proportion
of oxygen seems, an increase of but one-fifth more would
be destruction. It is the life-giver, but undiluted would be
the life-destroyer; and the three-fifths of nitrogen act as
its diluent. No other element possesses the same power.
Fires and light-giving combustion could not exist an
<a name="Page_21" id="Page_21"></a>instant without oxygen. Its office seems that of universal
destruction. By its action decay begins in meat or vegetables
and fruits; and it is for this reason, that, to preserve
them, all oxygen must be driven out by bringing them to
the boiling point, and sealing them up in jars to which no
air can find entrance. With only undiluted oxygen to
breathe, the tissues would dry and shrivel, fuel burn with
a fury none could withstand, and every operation of nature
be conducted with such energy as soon to exhaust and
destroy all power. But &quot;a mixture of the fiery oxygen
and inert nitrogen gives us the golden mean. The
oxygen now quietly burns the fuel in our stoves, and keeps
us warm; combines with the oil in our lamps, and gives us
light; corrodes our bodies, and gives us strength; cleanses
the air, and keeps it fresh and invigorating; sweetens foul
water, and makes it wholesome; works all around us and
within us a constant miracle, yet with such delicacy and
quietness, we never perceive or think of it, until we see it
with the eye of science.&quot;</p>

<p>Food and air are the two means by which bodies live.
In the full-grown man, whose weight will average about
one hundred and fifty-four pounds, one hundred and eleven
pounds is oxygen drawn from the air we breathe. Only
when food has been dissolved in the stomach, absorbed
at last into the blood, and by means of circulation brought
into contact with the oxygen of the air taken into
our lungs, can it begin to really feed and nourish the
body; so that the lungs may, after all, be regarded as
the true stomach, the other being not much more than the
food-receptacle.</p>

<p>Take these lungs, made up within of branching tubes,
these in turn formed by myriads of air-cells, and each air-<a name="Page_22" id="Page_22"></a>cell
owning its network of minute cells called <i>capillaries</i>.
To every air-cell is given a blood-vessel bringing blood
from the heart, which finds its way through every capillary
till it reaches another blood-vessel that carries it back to
the heart. It leaves the heart charged with carbonic acid
and watery vapor. It returns, if pure air has met it in
the lung, with all corruption destroyed, a dancing particle
of life. But to be life, and not slow death, thirty-three
hogsheads of air must pass daily into the lungs, and
twenty-eight pounds of blood journey from heart to lungs
and back again three times in each hour. It rests wholly
with ourselves, whether this wonderful tide, ebbing and
flowing with every breath, shall exchange its poisonous
and clogging carbonic acid and watery vapor for life-giving
oxygen, or retain it to weigh down and debilitate every
nerve in the body.</p>

<p>With every thought and feeling some actual particles
of brain and nerve are dissolved, and sent floating on
this crimson current. With every motion of a muscle,
whether great or small, with every process that can take
place in the body, this ceaseless change of particles is
going on. Wherever oxygen finds admission, its union
with carbon to form carbonic acid, or with hydrogen to
form water, produces heat. The waste of the body is
literally burned up by the oxygen; and it is this burning
which means the warmth of a living body, its absence
giving the stony cold of the dead. &quot;Who shall deliver me
from the body of this death?&quot; may well be the literal question
for each day of our lives; and &quot;pure air&quot; alone can
secure genuine life. Breathing bad air reduces all the processes
of the body, lessens vitality; and thus, one in poor
health will suffer more from bad air than those who have
<a name="Page_23" id="Page_23"></a>become thoroughly accustomed to it. If weakened vitality
were the only result, it would not be so serious a matter;
but scrofula is soon fixed upon such constitutions, beginning
with its milder form as in consumption, but ending in
the absolute rottenness of bone and tissue. The invalid
may live in the healthiest climate, pass hours each day in
the open air, and yet undo or neutralize much of the good
of this by sleeping in an unventilated room at night. Diseased
joints, horrible affections of the eye or ear or skin,
are inevitable. The greatest living authorities on lung-diseases
pronounce deficient ventilation the chief cause
of consumption, and more fatal <i>than all other causes put
together</i>; and, even where food and clothing are both unwholesome,
free air has been found able to counteract
their effect.</p>

<p>In the country the balance ordained in nature has its
compensating power. The poisonous carbonic acid thrown
off by lungs and body is absorbed by vegetation whose
food it is, and which in every waving leaf or blade of
grass returns to us the oxygen we demand. Shut in a
close room all day, or even in a tolerably ventilated one,
there may be no sense of closeness; but go to the open
air for a moment, and, if the nose has not been hopelessly
ruined by want of education, it will tell unerringly the
degree of oxygen wanting and required.</p>

<p>It is ordinarily supposed that carbonic-acid gas, being
heavier, sinks to the bottom of the room, and that thus
trundle-beds, for instance, are especially unwholesome.
This would be so, were the gas pure. As a matter of
fact, however, being warmed in the body, and thus made
lighter, it rises into the common air, so that usually more
will be found at the top than at the bottom of a room.<a name="Page_24" id="Page_24"></a>
This gas is, however, not the sole cause of disease. From
both lungs and skin, matter is constantly thrown off, and
floats in the form of germs in all impure air. To a person
who by long confinement to close rooms has become
so sensitive that any sudden current of air gives a cold,
ventilation seems an impossibility and a cruelty; and the
problem becomes: How to admit pure air throughout the
house, and yet avoid currents and draughts. &quot;Night-air&quot;
is even more dreaded than the confined air of rooms; yet,
as the only air to be had at night must come under this
head, it is safer to breathe that than to settle upon carbonic
acid as lung-food for a third, at least, of the twenty-four
hours. As fires feed on oxygen, it follows that every
lamp, every gas-jet, every furnace, are so many appetites
satisfying themselves upon our store of food, and that, if
they are burning about us, a double amount of oxygen
must be furnished.</p>

<p>The only mode of ventilation that will work always and
without fail is that of a warm-air flue, the upward heated
air-current of which draws off the foul gases from the
room: this, supplemented by an opening on the opposite
side of the room for the admission of pure air, will accomplish
the desired end. An open fire-place will secure
this, provided the flue is kept warm by heat from the
kitchen fire, or some other during seasons when the fire-place
is not used. But perhaps the simplest way is to
have ample openings (from eight to twelve inches square)
at the top and bottom of each room, opening into the
chimney-flue: then, even if a stove is used, the flue can
be kept heated by the extension of the stove-pipe some
distance up within the chimney, and the ascending current
of hot air will draw the foul air from the room into
<a name="Page_25" id="Page_25"></a>the flue. This, as before stated, must be completed by a
fresh-air opening into the room on another side: if no
other can be had, the top of the window may be lowered
a little. The stove-pipe <i>extension</i> within the chimney
would better be of cast-iron, as more durable than the
sheet-iron. When no fire is used in the sleeping-rooms,
the chimney-flue must be heated by pipes from the kitchen
or other fires; and, with the provision for <i>fresh</i> air never
forgotten, this simple device will invariably secure pure
and well-oxygenated air for breathing. &quot;Fussy and expensive,&quot;
may be the comment; but the expense is less
than the average yearly doctor's bill, and the fussiness
nothing that your own hands must engage in. Only
let heads take it in, and see to it that no neglect is
allowed. In a southern climate doors and windows are
of necessity open more constantly; but at night they are
closed from the fear referred to, that night-air holds some
subtle poison. It is merely colder, and perhaps moister,
than day-air; and an extra bed-covering neutralizes this
danger. Once accustomed to sleeping with open windows,
you will find that taking cold is impossible.</p>

<p>If custom, or great delicacy of organization, makes unusual
sensitiveness to cold, have a board the precise width
of the window, and five or six inches high. Then raise
the lower sash, putting this under it; and an upward current
of air will be created, which will in great part purify
the room.</p>

<p>Beyond every thing, watch that no causes producing
foul air are allowed to exist for a moment. A vase of
neglected flowers will poison the air of a whole room.
In the area or cellar, a decaying head of cabbage, a basket
of refuse vegetables, a forgotten barrel of pork or beef
<a name="Page_26" id="Page_26"></a>brine, a neglected garbage pail or box, are all premiums
upon disease. Let air and sunlight search every corner
of the house. Insist upon as nearly spotless <i>cleanliness</i>
as may be, and the second prime necessity of the home
is secure.</p>

<p>When, as it is written, man was formed from the dust
of the earth, the Lord God &quot;breathed into his nostrils
the breath of life; and man became a <i>living soul</i>.&quot;</p>

<p>Shut off that breath of life, or poison it as it is daily
poisoned, and not only body, but soul, dies. The child,
fresh from its long day out of doors, goes to bed quiet,
content, and happy. It wakes up a little demon, bristling
with crossness, and determined not to &quot;be good.&quot; The
breath of life carefully shut out, death has begun its work,
and you are responsible. And the same criminal blunder
causes not only the child's suffering, but also the weakness
which makes many a delicate woman complain that
it &quot;takes till noon to get her strength up.&quot;</p>

<p>Open the windows. Take the portion to which you
were born, and life will grow easier.</p>

<h2>DRAINAGE AND WATER-SUPPLY.</h2>


<p>Air and sunshine having been assured for all parts of
the house in daily use, the next question must be an
unfailing and full supply of pure water. &quot;Dig a well, or
build near a spring,&quot; say the builders; and the well is
dug, or the spring tapped, under the general supposition
that water is clean and pure, simply because it is water,
while the surroundings of either spring or well are unnoticed.
Drainage is so comparatively new a question, that
only the most enlightened portions of the country consider
its bearings; and the large majority of people all
over the land not only do not know the interests involved
in it, but would resent as a personal slight any hint that
their own water-supply might be affected by deficient
drainage.</p>

<p>Pure water is simply oxygen and hydrogen, eight-ninths
being oxygen and but one-ninth hydrogen; the latter gas,
if pure, having, like oxygen, neither taste nor smell.
Rain-water is the purest type; and, if collected in open
vessels as it falls, is necessarily free from any possible
taint (except at the very first of a rain, when it washes
down considerable floating impurity from the atmosphere,
especially in cities). This mode being for obvious reasons
impracticable, cisterns are made, and rain conducted to
<a name="Page_28" id="Page_28"></a>them through pipes leading from the roof. The water
has thus taken up all the dust, soot, and other impurities
found upon the roof, and, unless filtered, can not be considered
desirable drink. The best cistern will include a filter
of some sort, and this is accomplished in two ways.
Either the cistern is divided into two parts, the water
being received on one side, and allowed to slowly filter
through a wall of porous brick, regarded by many as an
amply sufficient means of purification; or a more elaborate
form is used, the division in such case being into
upper and under compartments, the upper one containing
the usual filter of iron, charcoal, sponge, and gravel or
sand. If this water has a free current of air passing
over it, it will acquire more sparkle and character; but as
a rule it is flat and unpleasant in flavor, being entirely
destitute of the earthy salts and the carbonic-acid gas to
be found in the best river or spring water.</p>

<p>Distilled water comes next in purity, and is, in fact,
identical in character with rain-water; the latter being
merely steam, condensed into rain in the great alembic of
the sky. But both have the curious property of taking up
and dissolving <i>lead</i> wherever they find it; and it is for this
reason that lead pipes as leaders from or to cisterns should
<i>never</i> be allowed, unless lined with some other metal.</p>

<p>The most refreshing as well as most wholesome water
is river or spring water, perfectly filtered so that no possible
impurity can remain. It is then soft and clear;
has sufficient air and carbonic acid to make it refreshing,
and enough earthy salts to prevent its taking up lead, and
so becoming poisonous. River-water for daily use of
course requires a system of pipes, and in small places is
practically unavailable; so that wells are likely, in such
<a name="Page_29" id="Page_29"></a>case, to be the chief source of supply. Such water will
of course be spring-water, with the characteristics of the
soil through which it rises. If the well be shallow, and
fed by surface springs, all impurities of the soil will be
found in it; and thus to <i>dig deep</i> becomes essential, for
many reasons. Dr. Parker of England, in some papers
on practical hygiene, gives a clear and easily understood
statement of some causes affecting the purity of well-water.</p>

<p>&quot;A well drains an extent of ground around it, in the
shape of an inverted cone, which is in proportion to its
own depth and the looseness of the soil. In very loose
soils a well of sixty or eighty feet will drain a large area,
perhaps as much as two hundred feet in diameter, or even
more; but the exact amount is not, as far as I know, precisely
determined.</p>

<p>&quot;Certain trades pour their refuse water into rivers,
gas-works; slaughter-houses; tripe-houses; size, horn,
and isinglass manufactories; wash-houses, starch-works,
and calico-printers, and many others. In houses it is
astonishing how many instances occur of the water of
butts, cisterns, and tanks, getting contaminated by leaking
of pipes and other causes, such as the passage of sewer-gas
through overflow-pipes, &amp;c.</p>

<p>&quot;As there is now no doubt that typhoid-fever, cholera,
and dysentery may be caused by water rendered impure
by the evacuations passed in those diseases, and as simple
diarrhoea seems also to be largely caused by animal organic
[matter in] suspension or solution, it is evident how
necessary it is to be quick-sighted in regard to the possible
impurity of water from incidental causes of this kind.
Therefore all tanks and cisterns should be inspected regu<a name="Page_30" id="Page_30"></a>larly,
and any accidental source of impurity must be looked
out for. Wells should be covered; a good coping put
round to prevent substances being washed down; the distances
from cess-pools and dung-heaps should be carefully
noted; no sewer should be allowed to pass near a well.
The same precautions should be taken with springs. In
the case of rivers, we must consider if contamination can
result from the discharge of fecal matters, trade refuse,
&amp;c.&quot;</p>

<p>Now, suppose all such precautions have been disregarded.
Suppose, as is most usual, that the well is dug
near the kitchen-door,&mdash;probably between kitchen and
barn; the drain, if there is a drain from the kitchen,
pouring out the dirty water of wash-day and all other
days, which sinks through the ground, and acts as feeder
to the waiting well. Suppose the manure-pile in the barnyard
also sends down its supply, and the privies contribute
theirs. The water may be unchanged in color or
odor: yet none the less you are drinking a foul and horrible
poison; slow in action, it is true, but making you
ready for diphtheria and typhoid-fever, and consumption,
and other nameless ills. It is so easy to doubt or set
aside all this, that I give one case as illustration and
warning of all the evils enumerated above.</p>

<p>The State Board of Health for Massachusetts has long
busied itself with researches on all these points, and the
case mentioned is in one of their reports. The house described
is one in Hadley, built by a clergyman. &quot;It was
provided with an open well and sink-drain, with its deposit-box
in close proximity thereto, affording facility to
discharge its gases in the well as the most convenient
place. The cellar was used, as country cellars commonly
<a name="Page_31" id="Page_31"></a>are, for the storage of provisions of every kind, and the
windows were never opened. The only escape for the
soil-moisture and ground-air, except that which was absorbed
by the drinking-water, was through the crevices of
the floors into the rooms above. After a few months' residence
in the house, the clergyman's wife died of fever.
He soon married again; and the second wife also died of
fever, within a year from the time of marriage. His children
were sick. He occupied the house about two years.
The wife of his successor was soon taken ill, and barely
escaped with her life. A physician then took the house.
He married, and his wife soon after died of fever.
Another physician took the house, and within a few
months came near dying of erysipelas. He deserved it.
The house, meanwhile, received no treatment; the doctors,
according to their usual wont, even in their own
families, were satisfied to deal with the consequences, and
leave the causes to do their worst.</p>

<p>&quot;Next after the doctors, a school-teacher took the
house, and made a few changes, for convenience apparently,
for substantially it remained the same; for he,
too, escaped as by the skin of his teeth. Finally, after
the foreclosure of many lives, the sickness and fatality of
the property became so marked, that it became unsalable.
When at last sold, every sort of prediction was made as
to the risk of occupancy; but, by a thorough attention to
sanitary conditions, no such risks have been encountered.&quot;</p>

<p>These deaths were suicides,&mdash;ignorant ones, it is true,
not one stopping to think what causes lay at the bottom
of such &quot;mysterious dispensations.&quot; But, just as surely
as corn gives a crop from the seed sown, so surely typhoid
<a name="Page_32" id="Page_32"></a>fever and diphtheria follow bad drainage or the drinking
of impure water.</p>

<p>Boiling such water destroys the germs of disease; but
neither boiled water nor boiled germs are pleasant
drinking.</p>

<p>If means are too narrow to admit of the expense attendant
upon making a drain long enough and tight enough to
carry off all refuse water to a safe distance from the house,
then adopt another plan. Remember that to throw dirty
water on the ground near a well, is as deliberate poisoning
as if you threw arsenic in the well itself. Have a
large tub or barrel standing on a wheelbarrow or small
hand-cart; and into this pour every drop of dirty water,
wheeling it away to orchard or garden, where it will enrich
the soil, which will transform it, and return it to you, not
in disease, but in fruit and vegetables. Also see that the
well has a roof, and, if possible, a lattice-work about it,
that all leaves and flying dirt may be prevented from falling
into it. You do not want your water to be a solution
or tincture of dead leaves, dead frogs and insects, or stray
mice or kittens; and this it must be, now and again, if not
covered sufficiently to exclude such chances, <i>though not
the air</i>, which must be given free access to it.</p>

<p>As to hard and soft water, the latter is always most
desirable, as soft water extracts the flavor of tea and
coffee far better than hard, and is also better for all cooking
and washing purposes. Hard water results from a
superabundance of lime; and this lime &quot;cakes&quot; on the
bottom of tea-kettles, curdles soap, and clings to every
thing boiled in it, from clothes to meat and vegetables
(which last are always more tender if cooked in soft water;
though, if it be too soft, they are apt to boil to a porridge).</p>

<p><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33"></a>Washing-soda or borax will soften hard water, and
make it better for all household purposes; but rain-water,
even if not desired for drinking, will be found better than
any softened by artificial means.</p>

<p>If, as in many towns, the supply of drinking-water for
many families comes from the town pump or pumps, the
same principles must be attended to. A well in Golden
Square, London, was noted for its especially bright and
sparkling water, so much so that people sent from long
distances to secure it. The cholera broke out; and all
who drank from the well became its victims, though the
square seemed a healthy location. Analysis showed it to
be not only alive with a species of fungus growing in it,
but also weighted with dead organic matter from a neighboring
churchyard. Every tissue in the living bodies
which had absorbed this water was inflamed, and ready to
yield to the first epidemic; and cholera was the natural
outcome of such conditions. Knowledge should guard
against any such chances. See to it that no open cesspool
poisons either air or water about your home. Sunk
at a proper distance from the house, and connected with
it by a drain so tightly put together that none of the contents
can escape, the cesspool, which may be an elaborate,
brick-lined cistern, or merely an old hogshead thoroughly
tarred within and without, and sunk in the ground,
becomes one of the most important adjuncts of a good
garden. If, in addition to this, a pile of all the decaying
vegetable matter&mdash;leaves, weeds, &amp;c.&mdash;is made, all
dead cats, hens, or puppies finding burial there; and the
whole closely covered with earth to absorb, as fresh earth
has the power to do, all foul gases and vapors; and if
at intervals the pile is wet through with liquid from the
<a name="Page_34" id="Page_34"></a>cesspool, the richest form of fertilizer is secured, and one
of the great agricultural duties of man fulfilled,&mdash;that of
&quot;returning to the soil, as fertilizers, all the salts produced
by the combustion of food in the human body.&quot;</p>

<p>Where the water-supply is brought into the house from
a common reservoir, much the same rules hold good.
We can not of course control the character of the general
supply, but we can see to it that our own water and waste
pipes are in the most perfect condition; that traps and all
the best methods of preventing the escape of sewer-gas
into our houses are provided; that stationary or &quot;set&quot;
basins have the plug always in them; and that every
water-closet is provided with a ventilating pipe sufficiently
high and long to insure the full escape of all gases from the
house. Simple disinfectants used from time to time&mdash;chloride
of lime and carbolic acid&mdash;will be found useful,
and the most absolute cleanliness is at all times the first
essential.</p>

<p>With air and water at their best, the home has a reasonable
chance of escaping many of the sorrows brought by
disease or uncertain health; and, the power to work to the
best advantage being secured, we may now pass to the
forms that work must take.</p>

<h2>THE DAY'S WORK.</h2>


<p>It is safe to say that no class of women in the civilized
world is subjected to such incessant trials of temper,
and such temptation to be fretful, as the American housekeeper.
The reasons for this state of things are legion;
and, if in the beginning we take ground from which the
whole field may be clearly surveyed, we may be able to
secure a better understanding of what housekeeping
means, and to guard against some of the dangers accompanying
it.</p>

<p>The first difficulty lies in taking for granted that successful
housekeeping is as much an instinct as that which
leads the young bird to nest-building, and that no specific
training is required. The man who undertakes a business,
passes always through some form of apprenticeship, and
must know every detail involved in the management; but
to the large proportion of women, housekeeping is a combination
of accidental forces from whose working it is
hoped breakfasts and dinners and suppers will be evolved
at regular periods, other necessities finding place where
they can. The new home, prettily furnished, seems a
lovely toy, and is surrounded by a halo, which, as facts
assert themselves, quickly fades away. Moth and rust
and dust invade the most secret recesses. Breakage and
<a name="Page_36" id="Page_36"></a>general disaster attend the progress of Bridget or Chloe.
The kitchen seems the headquarters of extraordinary
smells, and the stove an abyss in its consumption of coal
or wood. Food is wasted by bad cooking, or ignorance
as to needed amounts, or methods of using left-over portions;
and, as bills pile up, a hopeless discouragement
often settles upon both wife and husband, and reproaches
and bitterness and alienation are guests in the home, to
which they need never have come had a little knowledge
barred them out.</p>

<p>In the beginning, then, be sure of one thing,&mdash;that all
the wisdom you have or can acquire, all the patience
and tact and self-denial you can make yours by the most
diligent effort, will be needed every day and every hour of
the day. Details are in themselves wearying, and to
most men their relation to housekeeping is unaccountable.
The day's work of a systematic housekeeper would confound
the best-trained man of business. In the woman's
hand is the key to home-happiness, but it is folly to assert
that all lies with her. Let it be felt from the beginning
that her station is a difficult one, that her duties are important,
and that judgment and skill must guide their performance;
let boys be taught the honor that lies in such
duties,&mdash;and there will be fewer heedless and unappreciative
husbands. On the other hand, let the woman remember
that the good general does not waste words on
hindrances, or leave his weak spots open to observation,
but, learning from every failure or defeat, goes on steadily
to victory. To fret will never mend a matter; and
&quot;Study to be quiet&quot; in thought, word, and action, is the
first law of successful housekeeping. Never under-estimate
the difficulties to be met, for this is as much an evil
<a name="Page_37" id="Page_37"></a>as over-apprehension. The best-arranged plans may be
overturned at a moment's notice. In a mixed family,
habits and pursuits differ so widely that the housekeeper
must hold herself in readiness to find her most cherished
schemes set aside. Absolute adherence to a system is
only profitable so far as the greatest comfort and well-being
of the family are affected; and, dear as a fixed
routine may be to the housekeeper's mind, it may often
well be sacrificed to the general pleasure or comfort. A
quiet, controlled mind, a soft voice, no matter what the
provocation to raise it may be, is &quot;an excellent thing in
woman.&quot; And the certainty that, hard as such control
may be, it holds the promise of the best and fullest life
here and hereafter, is a motive strong enough, one would
think, to insure its adoption. Progress may be slow, but
the reward for every step forward is certain.</p>

<p>We have already found that each day has its fixed routine,
and are ready now to take up the order of work,
which will be the same in degree whether one servant is
kept, or many, or none. The latter state of things will
often happen in the present uncertain character of household
service. Old family servants are becoming more and
more rare; and, unless the new generation is wisely
trained, we run the risk of being even more at their mercy
in the future than in the past.</p>

<p>First, then, on rising in the morning, see that a full
current of air can pass through every sleeping-room; remove
all clothes from the beds, and allow them to air at
least an hour. Only in this way can we be sure that the
impurities, thrown off from even the cleanest body by the
pores during the night, are carried off. A neat housekeeper
is often tempted to make beds, or have them
<a name="Page_38" id="Page_38"></a>made, almost at once; but no practice can be more unwholesome.</p>

<p>While beds and bedrooms are airing, breakfast is to be
made ready, the table set, and kitchen and dining-room
put in order. The kitchen-fire must first be built. If a
gas or oil stove can be used, the operations are all simpler.
If not, it is always best to have dumped the grate
the night before if coal is used, and to have laid the fire
ready for lighting. In the morning brush off all ashes,
and wipe or blacken the stove. Strong, thick gloves, and
a neat box for brushes, blacking, &amp;c., will make this a
much less disagreeable operation than it sounds. Rinse
out the tea-kettle, fill it with fresh water, and put over to
boil. Then remove the ashes, and, if coal is used, sift
them, as cinders can be burned a large part of the time
where only a moderate fire is desired.</p>

<p>The table can be set, and the dining or sitting room
swept, or merely brushed up and dusted, in the intervals
of getting breakfast. To have every thing clean, hot,
and not only well prepared but ready on time, is the first
law, not only for breakfast, but for every other meal.</p>

<p>After breakfast comes the dish-washing, dreaded by all
beginners, but needlessly so. With a full supply of all
conveniences,&mdash;plenty of soap and sapolio, which is far
better and cleaner to use than either sand or ashes;
with clean, soft towels for glass and silver; a mop, the
use of which not only saves the hands but enables you to
have hotter water; and a full supply of coarser towels for
the heavier dishes,&mdash;the work can go on swiftly. Let the
dish-pan be half full of hot soap and water. <i>Wash glass
first</i>, paying no attention to the old saying that &quot;hot
water rots glass.&quot; Be careful never to put glass into
<a name="Page_39" id="Page_39"></a>hot water, bottom first, as the sudden expansion may
crack it. Slip it in edgeways, and the finest and most
delicate cut-glass will be safe. <i>Wash silver next.</i> Hot
suds, and instant wiping on dry soft cloths, will retain the
brightness of silver, which treated in this way requires
much less polishing, and therefore lasts longer. If any
pieces require rubbing, use a little whiting made into a
paste, and put on wet. Let it dry, and then polish with a
chamois-skin. Once a month will be sufficient for rubbing
silver, if it is properly washed. <i>China comes next</i>&mdash;all
plates having been carefully scraped, and all cups
rinsed out. To fill the pan with unscraped and unrinsed
dishes, and pour half-warm water over the whole, is a
method too often adopted; and the results are found in
sticky dishes and lustreless silver. Put all china, silver,
and glass in their places as soon as washed. Then take
any tin or iron pans, wash, wipe with a dry towel, and put
near the fire to dry thoroughly. A knitting-needle or
skewer may be kept to dig out corners unreachable by
dishcloth or towel, and if perfectly dried they will remain
free from rust.</p>

<p>The cooking-dishes, saucepans, &amp;c., come next in order;
and here the wire dish-cloth will be found useful, as it
does not scratch, yet answers every purpose of a knife.
Every pot, kettle, and saucepan must be put into the pan
of hot water. If very greasy, it is well to allow them to
stand partly full of water in which a few drops of ammonia
have been put. The <i>outside must be washed</i> as carefully
as the inside. Till this is done, there will always be
complaint of the unpleasantness of handling cooking-utensils.
Properly done, they are as clean as the china
or glass.</p>

<p><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40"></a>Plated knives save much work. If steel ones are used,
they must be polished after every meal. In washing them,
see that the handles are never allowed to touch the water.
Ivory discolors and cracks if wet. Bristol-brick finely
powdered is the best polisher, and, mixed with a little
water, can be applied with a large cork. A regular knife-board,
or a small board on which you can nail three strips
of wood in box form, will give you the best mode of keeping
brick and cork in place. After rubbing, wash clean,
and wipe dry.</p>

<p>The dish-towels are the next consideration. A set
should be used but a week, and must be washed and
rinsed each day if you would not have the flavor of dried-in
dish-water left on your dishes. Dry them, if possible,
in the open air: if not, have a rack, and stand them near
the fire. On washing-days, let those that have been used
a week have a thorough boiling. The close, sour smell
that all housekeepers have noticed about dish-towels comes
from want of boiling and drying in fresh air, and is unpardonable
and unnecessary.</p>

<p>Keep hot water constantly in your kettles or water-pots,
by always remembering to fill with cold when you take
out hot. Put away every article carefully in its place.</p>

<p>If tables are stained, and require any scrubbing, remember
that to wash or scrub wood you must follow the grain,
as rubbing across it rubs the dirt in instead of taking it
off.</p>

<p>The same rule applies to floors. A clean, coarse cloth,
hot suds, and a good scrubbing-brush, will simplify the
operation. Wash off the table; then dip the brush in the
suds, and scour with the grain of the wood. Finally wash
off all soapy water, and wipe dry. To save strength, the
<a name="Page_41" id="Page_41"></a>table on which dishes are washed may be covered with
kitchen oilcloth, which will merely require washing and
wiping; with an occasional scrubbing for the table below.</p>

<p>The table must be cleaned as soon as the dishes are
washed, because if dishes stand upon tables the fragments
of food have time to harden, and the washing is made
doubly hard.</p>

<p>Leaving the kitchen in order, the bedrooms will come
next. Turn the mattresses daily, and make the bed
smoothly and carefully. Put the under sheet with the
wrong side next the bed, and the upper one with the
marked end always at the top, to avoid the part where
the feet lie, from being reversed and so reaching the face.
The sheets should be large enough to tuck in thoroughly,
three yards long by two and a half wide being none too
large for a double bed. Pillows should be beaten and
then smoothed with the hand, and the aim be to have
an even, unwrinkled surface. As to the use of shams,
whether sheet or pillow, it is a matter of taste; but in all
cases, covered or uncovered, let the bed-linen be daintily
clean.</p>

<p>Empty all slops, and with hot water wash out all the
bowls, pitchers, &amp;c., using separate cloths for these purposes,
and never toilet towels. Dust the room, arrange
every thing in place, and, if in summer, close the blinds,
and darken till evening, that it may be as cool as possible.</p>

<p>Sweeping days for bedrooms need come but once a
week, but all rooms used by many people require daily
sweeping; halls, passages, and dining and sitting rooms
coming under this head. Careful dusting daily will often
do away with the need of frequent sweeping, which wears
out carpets unnecessarily. A carpet-sweeper is a real
<a name="Page_42" id="Page_42"></a>economy, both in time and strength; but, if not obtainable,
a light broom carefully handled, not with a long stroke
which sends clouds of dust over every thing, but with a
short quick one, which only experience can give, is next
best. For a thorough sweeping, remove as many articles
from the room as possible, dusting each one thoroughly,
and cover the larger ones which must remain with old
sheets or large squares of common unbleached cotton
cloth, kept for this purpose. If the furniture is rep or
woolen of any description, dust about each button, that
no moth may find lodgment, and then cover closely. A
feather duster, long or short, as usually applied, is the
enemy of cleanliness. Its only legitimate use is for
the tops of pictures or books and ornaments; and such
dusting should be done <i>before</i> the room is swept, as well
as afterward, the first one removing the heaviest coating,
which would otherwise be distributed over the room.
For piano, and furniture of delicate woods generally,
old silk handkerchiefs make the best dusters. For all
ordinary purposes, squares of old cambric, hemmed, and
washed when necessary, will be found best. Insist upon
their being kept for this purpose, and forbid the use of
toilet towels, always a temptation to the average servant.
Remember that in dusting, the process should be a <i>wiping</i>;
not a flirting of the cloth, which simply sends the dust up
into the air to settle down again about where it was
before.</p>

<p>If moldings and wash-boards or wainscotings are
wiped off with a damp cloth, one fruitful source of dust
will be avoided. For all intricate work like the legs of
pianos, carved backs of furniture, &amp;c., a pair of small
bellows will be found most efficient. Brooms, dust-pan,
<a name="Page_43" id="Page_43"></a>and brushes long and short, whisk-broom, feather and
other dusters, should have one fixed place, and be returned
to it after every using. If oil-cloth is on halls or passages,
it should be washed weekly with warm milk and water, a
quart of skim-milk to a pail of water being sufficient.
Never use soap or scrubbing-brush, as they destroy both
color and texture.</p>

<p>All brass or silver-plated work about fire-place, doorknobs,
or bath-room faucets, should be cleaned once a
week and before sweeping. For silver, rub first with
powdered whiting moistened with a little alcohol or hot
water. Let it dry on, and then polish with a dry chamois-skin.
If there is any intricate work, use a small toothbrush.
Whiting, silver-soap, cloths, chamois, and brushes
should all be kept in a box together. In another may be
the rotten-stone necessary for cleaning brass, a small
bottle of oil, and some woolen cloths. Old merino or flannel
under-wear makes excellent rubbing-cloths. Mix the
rotten-stone with enough oil to make a paste; rub on with
one cloth, and polish with another. Thick gloves can be
worn, and all staining of the hands avoided.</p>

<p>The bedrooms and the necessary daily sweeping finished,
a look into cellar and store-rooms is next in order,&mdash;in
the former, to see that no decaying vegetable matter is
allowed to accumulate; in the latter, that bread-jar or
boxes are dry and sweet, and all stores in good condition.</p>

<p>Where there are servants, it should be understood that
the mistress makes this daily progress. Fifteen minutes or
half an hour will often cover the time consumed; but it should
be a fixed duty never omitted. A look into the refrigerator
or meat-safe to note what is left and suggest the best
use for it; a glance at towels and dish-cloths to see that
<a name="Page_44" id="Page_44"></a>all are clean and sweet, and another under all sinks and
into each pantry,&mdash;will prevent the accumulation of bones
and stray bits of food and dirty rags, the paradise of the
cockroach, and delight of mice and rats. A servant, if
honest, will soon welcome such investigation, and respect
her mistress the more for insisting upon it, and, if not,
may better find other quarters. One strong temptation to
dishonesty is removed where such inspection is certain, and
the weekly bills will be less than in the house where matters
are left to take care of themselves.</p>

<p>The preparation of dinner if at or near the middle of
the day, and the dish-washing which follows, end the
heaviest portion of the day's work; and the same order
must be followed. Only an outline can be given; each
family demanding variations in detail, and each head of a
family in time building up her own system. Remember,
however, that, if but one servant is kept, she can not do
every thing, and that your own brain must constantly supplement
her deficiencies, until training and long practice
have made your methods familiar. Even then she is
likely at any moment to leave, and the battle to begin
over again; and the only safeguard in time of such disaster
is personal knowledge as to simplest methods of
doing the work, and inexhaustible patience in training
the next applicant, finding comfort in the thought, that, if
your own home has lost, that of some one else is by so
much the gainer.</p>

<h2>FIRES, LIGHTS, AND THINGS TO WORK WITH.</h2>


<p>The popular idea of a fire to cook by seems to be, a
red-hot top, the cover of every pot and saucepan dancing
over the bubbling, heaving contents, and coal packed
in even with the covers. Try to convince a servant that
the lid need not hop to assure boiling, nor the fire rise
above the fire-box, and there is a profound skepticism,
which, even if not expressed, finds vent in the same
amount of fuel and the same general course of action as
before the remonstrance.</p>

<p>The modern stove has brought simplicity of working,
and yet the highest point of convenience, nearly to perfection.
With full faith that the fuel of the future will be
gas, its use is as yet, for many reasons, very limited; the
cost of gas in our smaller cities and towns preventing its
adoption by any but the wealthy, who are really in least
need of it. With the best gas-stoves, a large part of the
disagreeable in cooking is done away. No flying ashes,
no cinders, no uneven heat, affected by every change of
wind, but a steady flame, regulated to any desired point,
and, when used, requiring only a turn of the hand to end
the operation.</p>

<p>Ranges set in a solid brick-work are considered the
best form of cooking-apparatus; but there are some seri<a name="Page_46" id="Page_46"></a>ous
objections to their use, the first being the large amount
of fuel required, and then the intense heat thrown out.
Even with water in the house, they are not a necessity.
A water-back, fully as effectual as the range water-back,
can be set in any good stove, and connected with a boiler,
large or small, according to the size of the stove; and for
such stove, if properly managed, only about half the
amount of coal will be needed.</p>

<p>Fix thoroughly in your minds the directions for making
and keeping a fire; for, by doing so, one of the
heaviest expenses in housekeeping can be lessened fully
half.</p>

<p>First, then, remove the covers, and gather all ashes and
cinders from the inside top of the stove, into the grate.
Now put on the covers; shut the doors; close all the
draughts, and dump the contents of the grate into the
pan below. In some stoves there is an under-grate, to
which a handle is attached; and, this grate being shaken,
the ashes pass through to the ash-pan, and the cinders
remain in the grate. In that case, they can simply be
shoveled out into the extra coal-hod, all pieces of clinker
picked out, and a little water sprinkled on them. If all
must be dumped together, a regular ash-sifter will be
required, placed over a barrel which receives the ashes,
while the cinders remain, and are to be treated as described.</p>

<p>Into the grate put shavings or paper, or the fat pine
known as lightwood. If the latter be used, paper is unnecessary.
Lay on some small sticks of wood, <i>crossing them</i>
so that there may be a draught through them; add then
one or two sticks of hard wood, and set the shavings or
paper on fire, seeing that every draught is open. As
<a name="Page_47" id="Page_47"></a>soon as the wood is well on fire, cover with about six
inches of coal, the smaller, or nut-coal, being always
best for stove use. When the coal is burning brightly,
shut up all the dampers save the slide in front of the
grate, and you will have a fire which will last, without
poking or touching in any way, four hours. Even if a
little more heat is needed for ovens, and you open the
draughts, this rule still holds good.</p>

<p>Never, for any reason, allow the coal to come above
the edge of the fire-box or lining. If you do, ashes and
cinders will fall into the oven-flues, and they will soon be
choked up, and require cleaning. Another reason also lies
in the fact that the stove-covers resting on red-hot coals
soon burn out, and must be renewed; whereas, by carefully
avoiding such chance, a stove may be used many
years without crack or failure of any sort.</p>

<p>If fresh heat is required for baking or any purpose after
the first four hours, let the fire burn low, then take off
the covers, and with the poker <i>from the bottom</i> rake out
all the ashes thoroughly. Then put in two or three sticks
of wood, fill as before with fresh coal, and the fire is good
for another four hours or more. If only a light fire be
required after dinner for getting tea, rake only slightly;
then, fill with <i>cinders</i>, and close all the dampers. Half an
hour before using the stove, open them, and the fire will
rekindle enough for any ordinary purpose. As there is
great difference in the &quot;drawing&quot; of chimneys, the exact
time required for making a fire can not be given.</p>

<p>In using wood, the same principles apply; but of course
the fire must be fed much oftener. Grate-fires, as well as
those in the ordinary stove, are to be made in much the
same way. In a grate, a blower is fastened on until the coal
<a name="Page_48" id="Page_48"></a>is burning well; but, if the fire is undisturbed after its renewal,
it should burn from six to eight hours without further
attention. Then rake out the ashes, add coal, put on the
blower a few minutes, and then proceed as before. If an
exceedingly slow fire is desired, cover the top with cinders,
or with ashes moistened with water. In making a grate
or stove fire, keep a coarse cloth to lay before it, that
ashes may not spoil the carpet; and wipe about the fire-place
with a damp, coarse cloth. In putting on coal in
a sick-room, where noise would disturb the patient, it is a
good plan to put it in small paper bags or in pieces of
newspaper, in which it can be laid on silently. A short
table of degrees of heat in various forms of fuel is given
below; the degree required for baking, &amp;c, finding place
when we come to general operations in cooking.</p>

<p><i>Lights</i> are next in order. Gas hardly requires mention,
as the care of it is limited to seeing that it is not turned
too high, the flame in such case not only vitiating the air
of the room with double speed, but leaving a film of smoke
upon every thing in it. Kerosene is the oil most largely
used for lamps; and the light from either a student-lamp,
or the lamp to which a &quot;student-burner&quot; has been applied,
is the purest and steadiest now in use. A few simple
rules for the care of lamps will prevent, not only danger
of explosion, but much breakage of chimneys, smoking, &amp;c.</p>

<p>1. Let the wick always touch the bottom of the lamp,
<a name="Page_49" id="Page_49"></a>and see that the top is trimmed square and even across,
with a pair of scissors kept for the purpose.</p>

<p>2. Remember that a lamp, if burned with only a little
oil in it, generates a gas which is liable at any moment to
explode. Fill lamps to within half an inch of the top. If
filled brimming full, the outside of the lamp will be constantly
covered with the oil, even when unlighted; while as
soon as lighted, heat expanding it, it will run over, and
grease every thing near it.</p>

<p>3. In lighting a lamp, turn the wick up gradually, that
the chimney may heat slowly: otherwise the glass expands
too rapidly, and will crack.</p>

<p>4. Keep the wick turned high enough to burn freely.
Many persons turn down the wick to save oil, but the room
is quickly poisoned by the evil smell from the gas thus
formed. If necessary, as in a sick-room, to have little
light, put the lamp in the hall or another room, rather
than to turn it down.</p>

<p>5. Remember, that, as with the fire, plenty of fresh air
is necessary for a free blaze, and that your lamp must be
kept as free from dirt as the stove from ashes. In washing
the chimneys, use hot suds; and wipe with bits of
newspaper, which not only dry the glass better than a
cloth, but polish it also.</p>

<p>6. In using either student-lamps, whether German or
American, or the beautiful and costly forms known as
moderator-lamps, remember, that, to secure a clear flame,
the oil which accumulates in the cup below the wick, as
well as any surplus which has overflowed from the reservoir,
must be <i>poured out daily</i>. The neglect of this precaution
is the secret of much of the trouble attending the
easy getting out of order of expensive lamps, which will
<a name="Page_50" id="Page_50"></a>cease to be sources of difficulty if this rule be followed
carefully.</p>

<p>7. Keep every thing used in such cleaning in a small
box; the ordinary starch-box with sliding lid being excellent
for this purpose. Extra wicks, lamp-scissors, rags
for wiping off oil, can all find place here. See that lamp-rags
are burned now and then, and fresh ones taken; as
the smell of kerosene is very penetrating, and a room is
often made unpleasant by the presence of dirty lamp-rags.
If properly cared for, lamps need be no more offensive
than gas.</p>

<p><i>Things</i> to work with.</p>

<p>We have settled that our kitchen shall be neat, cheerful,
and sunny, with closets as much as possible near enough
together to prevent extra steps being taken. If the servant
is sufficiently well-trained to respect the fittings of a
well-appointed kitchen, and to take pleasure in keeping
them in order, the whole apparatus can be arranged in the
kitchen-closets. If, however, there is any doubt on this
point, it will be far better to have your own special table,
and shelf or so above it, where the utensils required for
your own personal use in delicate cooking can be arranged.</p>

<p>In any kitchen not less than two tables are required:
one for all rough work,&mdash;preparing meat, vegetables, &amp;c,
and dishing up meals; the other for general convenience.
The first must stand as near the sink and fire as possible;
and close to it, on a dresser, which it is well to have just
above the table and within reach of the hand, should be all
the essentials for convenient work, namely:&mdash;</p>

<p>A meat-block or board;</p>

<p>A small meat-saw;</p>

<p>A small cleaver and meat-knife;</p>

<p><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51"></a>Spoons, skewers, vegetable-cutters, and any other small
conveniences used at this table, such as potato-slicer, larding
and trussing needles, &amp;c.;</p>

<p>A chopping-knife and wooden tray or bowl;</p>

<p>Rolling-pin, and bread and pastry board;</p>

<p>Narrow-bladed, very sharp knife for paring, the French
cook-knife being the best ever invented for this purpose.</p>

<p>A deep drawer in the table for holding coarse towels
and aprons, balls of twine of two sizes, squares of cloth
used in boiling delicate fish or meats, &amp;c., will be found
almost essential. Basting-spoons and many small articles
can hang on small hooks or nails, and are more easily
picked up than if one must feel over a shelf for them.
These will be egg-beaters, graters, ladle, &amp;c. The same
dresser, or a space over the sink, must hold washing-pans
for meat and vegetables, dish-pans, tin measures from a
gill up to one quart, saucepans, milk-boiler, &amp;c. Below
the sink, the closet for iron-ware can be placed, or, if preferred,
be between sink and stove. A list in detail of
every article required for a comfortably-fitted-up kitchen
is given at the end of the book. House-furnishing stores
furnish elaborate and confusing ones. The present list
is simply what is needed for the most efficient work.
Of course, as you experiment and advance, it may be
enlarged; but the simple outfit can be made to produce
all the results likely to be needed, and many complicated
patent arrangements are hindrances, rather than helps.</p>

<p>The <i>Iron-ware</i> closet must hold at least two iron pots,
frying-pans large and small, and a Scotch kettle with frying-basket
for oysters, fish-balls, &amp;c.,&mdash;this kettle being a
broad shallow one four or five inches deep. Roasting-pans,
commonly called dripping-pans, are best of Russia
iron.</p>

<p><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52"></a><i>Tin-ware</i> must include colander, gravy and jelly strainers,
and vegetable-sifter or <i>pur&eacute;e</i>-sieve; six tin pie-plates,
and from four to six jelly-cake tins with straight edges;
and at least one porcelain-lined kettle, holding not less
than four quarts, while a three-gallon one for preserving
and canning is also desirable;</p>

<p>Muffin rings or pans; &quot;gem-pans;&quot;</p>

<p>Four bread-tins, of best tin (or, better still, Russia
iron), the best size for which is ten inches long by four
wide and four deep; the loaf baked in such pan requiring
less time, and giving a slice of just the right shape and
size;</p>

<p>Cake-tins of various shapes as desired, a set of small
tins being desirable for little cakes.</p>

<p>A small sifter in basket shape will be found good for
cake-making, and a larger one for bread; and spices can
be most conveniently kept in a spice-caster, which is a
stand holding six or eight small labeled canisters. Near
it can also be small tin boxes or glass cans for dried
sweet herbs, the salt-box, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The <i>Crockery</i> required will be: at least two large mixing-bowls,
holding not less than eight or ten quarts, and
intended for bread, cake, and many other purposes; a
bowl with lip to pour from, and also a smaller-sized one
holding about two quarts; half a dozen quart and pint
bowls;</p>

<p>Half a dozen one-and two-quart round or oval pudding-dishes
or nappies;</p>

<p>Several deep plates for use in putting away cold food;</p>

<p>Blancmange-molds, three sizes;</p>

<p>One large pitcher, also three-pint and quart sizes;</p>

<p>Yeast-jar, or, what is better, two or three Mason's glass
cans, kept for yeast.</p>

<p><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53"></a>This list does not include any crockery for setting a
servant's table; that being governed by the number kept,
and other considerations. Such dishes should be of
heavier ware than your own, as they are likely to receive
rougher handling; but there should be a full supply as one
means of teaching neatness.</p>

<p><i>Wooden-ware</i> is essential in the shape of a nest of
boxes for rice, tapioca, &amp;c.; and wooden pails for sugar,
Graham-flour, &amp;c.; while you will gradually accumulate
many conveniences in the way of jars, stone pots for
pickling, demijohns, &amp;c., which give the store-room, at
last, the expression dear to all thrifty housekeepers.</p>

<p>Scrubbing and water pails, scrubbing and blacking
brushes, soap-dishes, sand-box, knife-board, and necessities
in cleaning, must all find place, and, having found it,
keep it to the end; absolute order and system being the
first condition of comfortable housekeeping.</p>

<h2>WASHING-DAY, AND CLEANING IN GENERAL.</h2>


<p>Why Monday should be fixed upon as washing-day,
is often questioned; but, like many other apparently
arbitrary arrangements, its foundation is in common-sense.
Tuesday has its advantages also, soon to be mentioned;
but to any later period than Tuesday there are
serious objections. All clothing is naturally changed on
Sunday; and, if washed before dirt has had time to harden
in the fiber of the cloth, the operation is much easier.
The German custom, happily passing away, of washing
only annually or semi-annually, is both disgusting, and destructive
to health and clothes; the air of whatever room
such accumulations are stored in being poisoned, while
the clothes themselves are rubbed to pieces in the endeavor
to get out the long-seated dirt.</p>

<p>A weekly wash being the necessity if perfect cleanliness
exists, the simplest and best method of thoroughly accomplishing
it comes up for question. While few women are
obliged to use their own hands in such directions, plenty
of needy and unskilled workwomen who can earn a living
in no other way being ready to relieve us, it is yet quite
as necessary to know every detail, in order that the best
work may be required, and that where there is ignorance
of methods in such work they may be taught.</p>

<p><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55"></a>The advantages of washing on Tuesday are, that it
allows Monday for setting in order after the necessary
rest of Sunday, gives opportunity to collect and put in
soak all the soiled clothing, and so does away with the
objection felt by many good people to performing this
operation Sunday night.</p>

<p>To avoid such sin, bed-clothing is often changed on Saturday;
but it seems only part of the freshness and sweetness
which ought always to make Sunday the white-day
of the week, that such change should be made on that
morning, while the few minutes required for sorting the
clothes, and putting them in water, are quite as legitimate
as any needed operation.</p>

<p>If Monday be the day, then, Saturday night may be
chosen for filling the tubs, supposing the kitchen to be
unfurnished with stationary tubs. Sunday night enough
hot water can be added to make the whole just warm&mdash;not
hot. Now put in one tub all fine things,&mdash;collars and
cuffs, shirts and fine underwear. Bed-linen may be added,
or soaked in a separate tub; but table-linen must of
course be kept apart. Last, let the coarsest and most
soiled articles have another. Do not add soap, as if there
is any stain it is likely to set it. If the water is hard, a
little borax may be added. And see that the clothes are
pressed down, and well covered with water.</p>

<p>Monday morning, and the earlier the better (the morning
sun drying and sweetening clothes better than the
later), have the boiler full of clean warm suds. Soft soap
may be used, or a bar of hard dissolved in hot water, and
used like soft soap. All the water in which the clothes
have soaked should be drained off, and the hot suds poured
on. Begin with the cleanest articles, which when washed
<a name="Page_56" id="Page_56"></a>carefully are wrung out, and put in a tub of warm water.
Rinse out from this; rub soap on all the parts which are
most soiled, these parts being bands and sleeves, and put
them in the boiler with cold water enough to cover them.
To boil up once will be sufficient for fine clothes. Then
take them out into a tub of clean cold water; rinse them
in this, and then in a tub of water made very slightly blue
with the indigo-bag or liquid indigo. From this water
they must be wrung out very dry, and hung out, always
out of doors if possible. A wringer is much better than
wringing by hand, as the latter is more unequal, and also
often twists off buttons. The lines must be perfectly clean.
A galvanized-iron wire is best of all; as it never rusts, and
needs only to be wiped off each week. If rope is used,
never leave it exposed to weather, but bring it in after
each washing. A dirty, weather-stained line will often
ruin a nice garment. Leave clothes on the line till
perfectly dry. If any fruit-stains are on napkins or table-cloths,
lay the stained part over a bowl, and pour on
boiling water till they disappear. Ink can be taken out if
the spot is washed while fresh, in cold water, or milk and
water; and a little salt will help in taking out wine-stains.
Machine-oil must have a little lard or butter rubbed on the
spot, which is then to be washed in warm suds. Never
rub soap directly on any stain, as it sets it. For iron-rust,
spread the garment in the sun, and cover the spot
with salt; then squeeze on lemon-juice enough to wet it.
This is much safer and quite as sure as the acids sold for
this purpose. In bright sunshine the spot will disappear
in a few hours.</p>

<p>Remember that long boiling does not improve clothes.
If washed clean, simply scalding is all that is required.</p>

<p><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57"></a>If delicate curtains, either lace or muslin, are to be
washed, allow a tablespoonful of powdered borax to two
gallons of warm water, and soap enough to make a strong
suds. Soak the curtains in this all night. In the morning
add more warm water, and press every part between
the hands, without rubbing. Put them in fresh suds, and,
if the water still looks dark after another washing, take
still another. Boil and rinse as in directions given for
other clothes. Starch with very thick hot starch, and
dry, not by hanging out, and then ironing, but by putting
a light common mattress in the sun, and pinning
the curtain upon it, stretching carefully as you pin. One
mattress holds two, which will dry in an hour or two. If
there is no sun, lay a sheet on the floor of an unused
room, and pin the curtains down upon it.</p>

<p>In washing flannels, remember that it must be done in
a sunny day, that they may dry as rapidly as possible.
Put them into hot suds. Do not rub them on a washing-board,
as this is one means of fulling and ruining them.
Press and rub them in the hands, changing them soon to
fresh hot suds. Rinse in a pail of clear hot water;
wring very dry; shake, and hang at once in the sun.
Flannels thus treated, no matter how delicate, retain their
softness and smoothness, and do not shrink.</p>

<p>Starch is the next consideration, and is made in two
ways,&mdash;either raw or boiled. Boiled starch is made by
adding cold water to raw starch in the proportion of one
cup of water to three-quarters of a cup of starch, and
then pouring on boiling water till it has thickened to a
smooth mass, constantly stirring as you pour. A bit of
butter is added by many excellent laundresses, the bit
not to be larger than a filbert. Any thing starched with
<a name="Page_58" id="Page_58"></a>boiled starch must be dried and sprinkled before ironing,
while with raw starch this is not necessary.</p>

<p>To make raw starch, allow four even tablespoonfuls to
a half-pint of cold water. Dip collars, cuffs, and shirt-bosoms,
or any thing which must be very stiff, into this
starch, being careful to have them dry. When wet, clap
them well between the hands, as this distributes the starch
evenly among the fibers of the cloth. The same rule
must be followed in using boiled starch. Roll the articles
in a damp cloth, as this makes them iron more smoothly;
and in an hour they will be ready for the iron. In using
boiled starch, after the articles have been dried, and then
dampened by sprinkling water lightly upon them, either
by the hand, or by shaking over them a small whisk-broom
which is dipped as needed in water, it is better
to let them lie ten or twelve hours.</p>

<p>All clothes require this folding and dampening. Sheets
and table-cloths should be held by two persons, shaken
and &quot;snapped,&quot; and then folded carefully, stretching the
edges if necessary.</p>

<p>Colored clothing must be rinsed before starching, and
the starch should be thin and cool.</p>

<p>For ironing neatly and well, there will be required,
half a dozen flat-irons, steel bottoms preferred; a skirt-board
and bosom-board, both covered, first with old blanket
or carpet, then with thick strong cotton-cloth, and
over this a cover of lighter cloth, sewed on so that it may
be removed as often as may be necessary to wash it. If
a bag the size of each is made, and they are hung up
in this as soon as used, such washing need very seldom
be. Having these, many dispense with ironing-sheet
and blanket; but it is better to use a table for all large
<a name="Page_59" id="Page_59"></a>articles, and on this the ironing-sheet can be pinned, or
tied by tapes, or strips of cloth, sewed to each corner. A
stand on which to set the irons, a paper and coarse cloth
to rub them off on, and a bit of yellow wax tied in a cloth,
and used to remove any roughness from the iron, are the
requirements of the ironing-table.</p>

<p>Once a month, while the irons are still slightly warm,
wash them in warm water in which a little lard has been
melted. Never let them stand day after day on the stove,
and never throw cold water on them, as it makes them
very rough.</p>

<p>If the starch clings to the irons, put a little Bristol-brick
on a board, and rub them up and down till free. If they
are too hot for use, put in a current of air a few moments;
and in all cases try them on a piece of paper or cloth before
putting them on a garment. If through carelessness
or accident an article is scorched, lay it in the hottest sunshine
to be found. If the fiber is not burned, this will
often take the spot entirely out.</p>

<p>Let the ironed clothes hang in the air for at least
twenty-four hours after ironing. Unaired sheets have
often brought on fatal sickness. Examine all clothes sent
up from the wash. If the laundress is sure this inspection
will take place, it is a constant spur to working in the
best way, and a word of praise for good points is always
a stimulus. Mending should be done as the clothes are
looked over, before putting away. Place the sheets from
each wash at the bottom of the pile, that the same ones
may not be used over and over, but all come in rotation;
and the same with table-linen. If the table-cloth in use
is folded carefully in the creases, and kept under a heavy
piece of plank, it will retain a fresh look till soiled.<a name="Page_60" id="Page_60"></a>
Special hints as to washing blankets and dress-materials
will be given in the latter part of the book.</p>

<p>However carefully and neatly a house may be kept, it
requires a special putting in order, known as <i>House-cleaning</i>,
at least once a year. Spring and fall are both
devoted to it in New England; and, if the matter be conducted
quietly, there are many advantages in the double
cleaning. In a warmer climate, where insect-life is more
troublesome and the reign of flies lasts longer, two cleanings
are rather a necessity. As generally managed, they
are a terror to every one, and above all to gentlemen, who
resent it from beginning to end. No wonder, if at the
first onslaught all home comfort ends, and regular meals
become irregular lunches, and a quiet night's rest something
sought but not found.</p>

<p>A few simple rules govern here, and will rob the ordeal
of half its terrors.</p>

<p>If coal or wood are to be laid in for the year's supply,
let it be done before cleaning begins, as much dust is
spread through the house in such work.</p>

<p>Heavy carpets do not require taking up every year; once
in two, or even three, being sufficient unless they are in
constant use. Take out the tacks, however, each year;
fold back the carpet half a yard or so; have the floor
washed with a strong suds in which borax has been dissolved,&mdash;a
tablespoonful to a pail of water; then dust
black pepper along the edges, and retack the carpet. By
this means moths are kept away; and, as their favorite
place is in corners and folds, this laying back enables one
to search out and destroy them.</p>

<p>Sapolio is better than sand for scouring paint, and in
all cases a little borax in the water makes such work
easier.</p>

<p><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61"></a>Closets should be put in order first; all winter clothing
packed in trunks, or put in bags made from several thicknesses
of newspaper, printers' ink being one of the most
effectual protections against moths. Gum-camphor is
also excellent; and, if you have no camphor-wood chest
or closet, a pound of the gum, sewed into little bags, will
last for years. In putting away clothing, blankets, &amp;c.,
look all over, and brush and shake with the utmost care
before folding, in order to get rid of any possible moth-eggs.</p>

<p>If matting is used, wipe it with borax-water, using a
cloth wet enough to dampen but <i>not</i> wet.</p>

<p>Window-glass thoroughly washed can be dried and polished
with old newspapers; or whiting can be used, and
rubbed off with a woolen cloth.</p>

<p>Hard-wood furniture, black walnut, or other varieties,
requires oiling lightly with boiled linseed oil, and rubbing
dry with a woolen cloth; and varnished furniture, mahogany
or rosewood, if kept carefully dusted, requires
only an occasional rubbing with chamois-skin or thick
flannel to retain its polish perfectly. Soap should never
be used on varnish of any sort.</p>

<p>Ingrain and other carpets, after shaking, are brightened
in color by sprinkling a pound or two of salt over the
surface, and sweeping carefully; and it is also useful to
occasionally wipe off a carpet with borax-water, using a
thick flannel, and taking care not to wet, but only dampen
the carpet. Mirrors can be cleaned with whiting. Never
scrub oil-pictures: simply wipe with a damp cloth, and, if
picture-cord is used, wipe it off to secure against moths.</p>

<p>It is impossible to cover the whole ground of cleaning
in this chapter. Experience is the best teacher. Only
<a name="Page_62" id="Page_62"></a>remember that a household earthquake is not necessary,
and that the whole work can be done so gradually, quietly,
and systematically, that only the workers need know much
about it. The sense of purity transfused through the air
and breathing from every nook and corner should be the
only indication that upheaval has existed. The best work
is always in silence.</p>

<h2>THE BODY AND ITS COMPOSITION.</h2>


<p>&quot;The lamp of life&quot; is a very old metaphor for the
mysterious principle vitalizing nerve and muscle;
but no comparison could be so apt. The full-grown adult
takes in each day, through lungs and mouth, about eight
and a half pounds of dry food, water, and the air necessary
for breathing purposes. Through the pores of the skin,
the lungs, kidneys, and lower intestines, there is a corresponding
waste; and both supply and waste amount in a
year to one and a half tons, or three thousand pounds.</p>

<p>The steadiness and clear shining of the flame of a lamp
depend upon quality, as well as amount of the oil supplied,
and, too, the texture of the wick; and so all human
life and work are equally made or marred by the food
which sustains life, as well as the nature of the constitution
receiving that food.</p>

<p>Before the nature and quality of food can be considered,
we must know the constituents of the body to be fed,
and something of the process through which digestion and
nutrition are accomplished.</p>

<p>I shall take for granted that you have a fairly plain idea
of the stomach and its dependences. Physiologies can
always be had, and for minute details they must be referred
to. Bear in mind one or two main points: that all food
passes from the mouth to the stomach, an irregularly-<a name="Page_64" id="Page_64"></a>shaped
pouch or bag with an opening into the duodenum,
and from thence into the larger intestine. From the mouth
to the end of this intestine, the whole may be called the
alimentary canal; a tube of varying size and some thirty-six
feet in length. The mouth must be considered part of
it, as it is in the mouth that digestion actually begins;
all starchy foods depending upon the action of the saliva
for genuine digestion, saliva having some strange power
by which starch is converted into sugar. Swallowed
whole, or placed directly in the stomach, such food passes
through the body unchanged. Each division of the alimentary
canal has its own distinct digestive juice, and I
give them in the order in which they occur.</p>

<p>First, The saliva; secreted from the glands of the
mouth:&mdash;alkaline, glairy, adhesive.</p>

<p>Second, The gastric juice; secreted in the inner or third
lining of the stomach,&mdash;an acid, and powerful enough to
dissolve all the fiber and albumen of flesh food.</p>

<p>Third, The pancreatic juice; secreted by the pancreas,
which you know in animals as sweetbreads. This juice
has a peculiar influence upon fats, which remain unchanged
by saliva and gastric juice; and not until dissolved by
pancreatic juice, and made into what chemists call an
<i>emulsion</i>, can they be absorbed into the system.</p>

<p>Fourth, The bile; which no physiologist as yet thoroughly
understands. We know its action, but hardly <i>why</i>
it acts. It is a necessity, however; for if by disease the
supply be cut off, an animal emaciates and soon dies.</p>

<p>Fifth, The intestinal juice; which has some properties
like saliva, and is the last product of the digestive forces.</p>

<p>A meal, then, in its passage downward is first diluted
and increased in bulk by a watery fluid which prepares all
<a name="Page_65" id="Page_65"></a>the starchy portion for absorption. Then comes a still
more profuse fluid, dissolving all the meaty part. Then
the fat is attended to by the stream of pancreatic juice,
and at the same time the bile pours upon it, doing its own
work in its own mysterious way; and last of all, lest any
process should have been imperfect, the long canal sends
out a juice having some of the properties of all.</p>

<p>Thus each day's requirements call for</p>

<p>Do not fancy this is all wasted or lost. Very far from
it: for the whole process seems to be a second circulation,
as it were; and, while the blood is moving in its wonderful
passage through veins and arteries, another circulation as
wonderful, an endless current going its unceasing round
so long as life lasts, is also taking place. But without
food the first would become impossible; and the quality of
food, and its proper digestion, mean good or bad blood as
the case may be. We must follow our mouthful of food,
and see how this action takes place.</p>

<p>When the different juices have all done their work, the
<i>chyme</i>, which is food as it passes from the stomach into
the duodenum or passage to the lower stomach or bowels,
becomes a milky substance called <i>chyle</i>, which moves
slowly, pushed by numberless muscles along the bowel,
which squeeze much of it into little glands at the back of
the bowels. These are called the mesenteric glands; and,
<a name="Page_66" id="Page_66"></a>as each one receives its portion of chyle, a wonderful thing
happens. About half of it is changed into small round
bodies called corpuscles, and they float with the rest of
the milky fluid through delicate pipes which take it to a
sort of bag just in front of the spine. To this bag is
fastened another pipe or tube&mdash;the thoracic duct&mdash;which
follows the line of the spine; and up this tube the small
bodies travel till they come to the neck and a spot where
two veins meet. A door in one opens, and the transformation
is complete. The small bodies are raw food no
more, but blood, traveling fast to where it may be purified,
and begin its endless round in the best condition. For, as
you know, venous blood is still impure and dirty blood.
Before it can be really alive it must pass through the
veins to the right side of the heart, flow through into the
upper chamber, then through another door or valve into
the lower, where it is pumped out into the lungs. If these
lungs are, as they should be, full of pure air, each corpuscle
is so charged with oxygen, that the last speck of
impurity is burned up, and it goes dancing and bounding
on its way. That is what health means: perfect food
made into perfect blood, and giving that sense of strength
and exhilaration that we none of us know half as much
about as we should. We get it sometimes on mountain-tops
in clear autumn days when the air is like wine; but
God meant it to be our daily portion, and this very despised
knowledge of cookery is to bring it about. If a
lung is imperfect, supplied only with foul air as among the
very poor, or diseased as in consumption, food does not
nourish, and you now know why. We have found that the
purest air and the purest water contain the largest proportion
of oxygen; and it is this that vitalizes both food and,
through food, the blood.</p>

<p><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67"></a>To nourish this body, then, demands many elements;
and to study these has been the joint work of chemists
and physiologists, till at last every constituent of the body
is known and classified. Many as these constituents are,
they are all resolved into the simple elements, oxygen,
hydrogen, nitrogen, and carbon, while a little sulphur, a
little phosphorus, lime, chlorine, sodium, &amp;c., are added.</p>

<p>FLESH and BLOOD are composed of water, fat, fibrine,
albumen, gelatine, and the compounds of lime, phosphorus,
soda, potash, magnesia, iron, &amp;c.</p>

<p>BONE contains cartilage, gelatine, fat, and the salts of
lime, magnesia, soda, &amp;c., in combination with phosphoric
and other acids.</p>

<p>CARTILAGE consists of chondrine, a substance somewhat
like gelatine, and contains also the salts of sulphur, lime,
soda, potash, phosphorus, magnesia, and iron.</p>

<p>BILE is made up of water, fat, resin, sugar, cholesterine,
some fatty acids, and the salts of potash, iron, and soda.</p>

<p>THE BRAIN is made up of water, albumen, fat, phosphoric
acid, osmazone, and salts.</p>

<p>THE LIVER unites water, fat, and albumen, with phosphoric
and other acids, and lime, iron, soda, and potash.</p>

<p>THE LUNGS are formed of two substances: one like gelatine;
another of the nature of caseine and albumen,
fibrine, cholesterine, iron, water, soda, and various fatty
and organic acids.</p>

<p>How these varied elements are held together, even
science with all its deep searchings has never told. No
man, by whatsoever combination of elements, has ever
made a living plant, much less a living animal. No better
comparison has ever been given than that of Youmans,
who makes a table of the analogies between the human
body and the steam-engine, which I give as it stands.<a name="Page_68" id="Page_68"></a></p>

<p>Carrying out this analogy, you will at once see why a
person working hard with either body or mind requires
more food than the one who does but little. The food
taken into the human body can never be a simple element.
We do not feed on plain, undiluted oxygen or nitrogen;
and, while the composition of the human body includes
really sixteen elements in all, oxygen is the only one used
in its natural state. I give first the elements as they exist
in a body weighing about one hundred and fifty-four
<a name="Page_69" id="Page_69"></a>pounds, this being the average weight of a full-grown
man; and add a table, compiled from different sources, of
the composition of the body as made up from these elements.
Dry as such details may seem, they are the only
key to a full understanding of the body, and the laws of
the body, so far as the food-supply is concerned; though
you will quickly find that the day's food means the day's
thought and work, well or ill, and that in your hands is
put a power mightier than you know,&mdash;the power to build
up body, and through body the soul, into a strong and
beautiful manhood and womanhood.</p>

<p>With this basis, to give us some understanding of the complicated and
delicate machinery with which we must work, the question arises, what food
contains all these constituents, and what its amount and character must
be. The answer to this question will help us to form an intelligent plan
for providing a family with the right nutrition.</p>


<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII" />CHAPTER VIII.</h2>
<p><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73"></a></p>

<h2>FOOD AND ITS LAWS.</h2>

<p>We have found, that, in analyzing the constituents of
the body, water is the largest part; and turning
to food, whether animal or vegetable, the same fact holds
good. It forms the larger part of all the drinks, of fruits,
of succulent vegetables, eggs, fish, cheese, the cereals,
and even of fats.</p>

<p>Fat is found in butter, lard, drippings, milk, eggs,
cheese, fish, meat, the cereals, leguminous vegetables,&mdash;such
as pease and beans,&mdash;nuts, cocoa, and chocolate.</p>

<p>Sugar abounds in fruits and vegetables, and is found in
milk and cereals.</p>

<p>Starch, which under the action of the saliva changes
into glucose or grape-sugar, is present in vegetables and
cereals.</p>

<p>Flesh foods, called as often nitrogenous foods, from
containing so large a proportion of nitrogen, are made up
of fibrine, albumen, caseine, gelatine, and gluten; the first
four elements being present in flesh, the latter in vegetables.</p>

<p>Salts of various forms exist in both animal and vegetable
food. In meat, fish, and potatoes are found phosphorus,
lime, and magnesia. Common salt is largely made
up of soda, but is found with potash in many vegetables.
This last element is also in meat, fish, milk, vegetables,
and fruits. Iron abounds in flesh and vegetables; and
sulphur enters into albumen, caseine, and fibrine.</p>

<p>The simplest division of food is into <i>flesh-formers</i> and
<i>heat-producers</i>; the former being as often called nitrogenous
food, or albumenoids; the latter, heat-giving or carbonaceous
foods. Much minuter divisions could be made,
but these two cover the ground sufficiently well. For a
healthy body both are necessary, but climate and constitution
will always make a difference in the amounts required.
Thus, in a keen and long-continued winter, the
most condensed forms of carbonaceous foods will be
needed; while in summer a small portion of nitrogenous
food to nourish muscle, and a large amount of cooling
fruits and vegetables, are indicated; both of these, though
more or less carbonaceous in character, containing so
much water as to neutralize any heat-producing effects.</p>

<p>Muscle being the first consideration in building up a
strong body, we need first to find out the values of different
foods as flesh-formers, healthy flesh being muscle in
its most perfect condition. Flesh and fat are never to be
confounded, fat being really a species of disease,&mdash;the
overloading of muscle and tissue with what has no rightful
place there. There should be only enough fat to round
over the muscle, but never hide its play. The table given
is the one in use in the food-gallery of the South Kensington
Museum, and includes not only the nutritive value, but
the cost also, of each article; taking beef as the standard
with which other animal foods are to be compared, beef
being the best-known of all meats. Among vegetables,
lentils really contain most nourishment; but wheat is chosen
as being much more familiar, lentils being very little
used in this country save by the German part of the population,
and having so strong and peculiar a flavor that we
are never likely to largely adopt their use.</p>

<p>About an equal amount of nourishment is found in the
varied amounts mentioned in the table which follows:&mdash;</p>

</table></div>


<p>Now, because tea, coffee, and cocoa approach so nearly
in value as nutriment to beef and lentils, we must not be
misled. Fourteen ounces of tea are equivalent to half a
pound of meat; but a repast of dry tea not being very
usual, in fact, being out of the question altogether, it
becomes plain, that the principal value of these foods,
used as we must use them, in very small quantities, is in
the warmth and comfort they give. Also, these weights
(except the bread) are of uncooked food. Eight ounces
of meat would, if boiled or roasted, dwindle to five or six,
while the ten ounces of lentils or beans would swell to twice
<a name="Page_76" id="Page_76"></a>the capacity of any ordinary stomach. So, ten pounds
of potatoes are required to give you the actual benefit contained
in the few ounces of meat; and only the Irishman
fresh from his native cabin can calmly consider a meal of
that magnitude, while, as to carrots, neither Irishman nor
German, nor the most determined and enterprising American,
could for a moment face the spectacle of fifteen
pounds served up for his noonday meal.</p>

<p>The inference is plain. Union is strength, here as elsewhere;
and the perfect meal must include as many of
these elements as will make it not too bulky, yet borrowing
flavor and substance wherever necessary.</p>

<p>As a rule, the food best adapted to climate and constitution
seems to have been instinctively decided upon by
many nations; and a study of national dishes, and their
adaptation to national needs, is curious and interesting.
The Esquimaux or Greenlander finds his most desirable
meal in a lump of raw blubber, the most condensed form
of carbonaceous food being required to preserve life. It
is not a perverted taste, but the highest instinct; for in
that cruel cold the body must furnish the food on which
the keen air draws, and the lamp of life there has a very
literal supply.</p>

<p>Take now the other extreme of temperature,&mdash;the
East Indies, China, Africa, and part even of the West
Indies and America,&mdash;and you find rice the universal
food. There is very little call, as you may judge, for heat-producers,
but rather for flesh-formers; and starch and
sugar both fulfill this end, the rice being chiefly starch,
which turns into sugar under the action of the saliva.
Add a little melted butter, the East Indian <i>ghee</i>, or olive-oil
used in the West Indies instead, and we have all the
elements necessary for life under those conditions.</p>

<p><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77"></a>A few degrees northward, and the same rice is mingled
with bits of fish or meat, as in the Turkish <i>pilau</i>, a dish
of rice to which mutton or poultry is added.</p>

<p>The wandering Arab finds in his few dates, and handful
of parched wheat or maize, the sugar and starch holding
all the heat required, while his draught of mare's or
camel's milk, and his occasional <i>pilau</i> of mutton, give
him the various elements which seem sufficient to make
him the model of endurance, blitheness, and muscular
power. So the Turkish burden-bearers who pick up a
two-hundred-pound bag of coffee as one picks up a pebble,
use much the same diet, though adding melons and
cucumbers, which are eaten as we eat apples.</p>

<p>The noticeable point in the Italian dietary is the universal
and profuse use of macaroni. Chestnuts and Indian
corn, the meal of which is made into a dish called <i>polenta</i>,
something like our mush, are also used, but macaroni is
found at every table, noble or peasant's. No form of
wheat presents such condensed nourishment, and it deserves
larger space on our own bills of fare than we have
ever given it.</p>

<p>In Spain we find the <i>olla podrida</i>, a dish containing, as
chief ingredient, the <i>garbanzo</i> or field-pea: it is a rich
stew, of fowls or bacon, red peppers, and pease. Red
pepper enters into most of the dishes in torrid climates,
and there is a good and sufficient reason for this apparent
mistake. Intense and long-continued heat weakens the
action of the liver, and thus lessens the supply of bile; and
red pepper has the power of stimulating the liver, and so
assisting digestion. East Indian curries, and the Mexican
and Spanish <i>olla</i>, are therefore founded on common-sense.</p>

<p>In France the <i>pot-au-feu</i>, or soup-pot, simmers in every
<a name="Page_78" id="Page_78"></a>peasant or middle-class home, and is not to be despised
even in richer ones. In this dish, a small portion of meat
is cooked so judiciously as to flavor a large mass of vegetables
and broth; and this, served with salad and oil and
bread, forms a meal which can hardly be surpassed in its
power of making the most of every constituent offered.
In Germany soups are a national dish also; but their
extreme fondness for pork, especially raw ham and sausage,
is the source of many diseases. Sweden, Norway,
Russia,&mdash;all the far northern countries,&mdash;tend more and
more to the oily diet of the Esquimaux, fish being a large
part of it. There is no room for other illustrations; but,
as you learn the properties of food, you will be able to
read national dietaries, from the Jewish down, with a
new understanding of what power food had and has in
forming national peculiarities.</p>

<p>It is settled, then, that to renew our muscles which are
constantly wearing out, we must eat the food containing
the same constituents; and these we find in meat, milk,
eggs, and the entire gluten of grains, &amp;c, as in wheaten-grits
or oatmeal.</p>

<p>Fat and heat must come to us from the starches and
sugars, in sufficient supply to &quot;put a layer of wadding
between muscles and skin, fill out the wrinkles, and keep
one warm.&quot; To find out the proportion needed for one's
own individual constitution, is the first work for all of us.
The laborer requires one thing, the growing child another,
the man or woman whose labor is purely intellectual
another; and to understand how best to meet
these needs, demands a knowledge to which most of us
have been indifferent. If there is excess or lack of any
necessary element, that excess or lack means disease, and
<a name="Page_79" id="Page_79"></a>for such disease we are wholly responsible. Food is not
the only and the universal elixir of life; for weak or poor
blood is often an inheritance, and comes to one tainted
by family diseases, or by defects in air or climate in
general. But, even when outward conditions are most
disastrous, perfect food has power to avert or alter their
effects; and the child who begins life burdened with
scrofulous or other diseases, and grows to a pale, weak,
unwholesome youth, and either a swift passing into the
next world, or a life here of hopeless invalidism, can,
nine times out of ten, have this course of things stopped
by scientific understanding of what foods are necessary
for such conditions.</p>

<p>I propose to take the life of one who from babyhood up
has been fed on the best food, perfectly prepared, and to
give the tables of such food for different periods in that
life, allowing only such digression as will show the effects
of an opposite course of treatment; thus showing the relations
of food to health,&mdash;a more necessary and vital
form of knowledge than any other that the world owns.</p>

<h2>THE RELATIONS OF FOOD TO HEALTH.</h2>


<p>We begin, then, with a typical baby, born of civilized
parents, and living in the midst of the best civilization
to be had. Savage or even partially civilized life
could never furnish the type we desire. It is true, as we
have seen, that natural laws, so deeply planted that they
have become instincts, have given to many wild nations a
dietary meeting their absolute needs; but only civilization
can find the key to these modes, and make past experience
pay tribute to present knowledge. We do not want an
Indian baby, bound and swathed like a little mummy,
hanging from the pole of a wigwam, placidly sucking a
fish's tail, or a bone of boiled dog; nor an Esquimaux
baby, with its strip of blubber; nor the Hottentot, with
its rope of jerked beef; nor the South-sea Islander, with
its half-cocoanut. Nor will we admit the average Irish
baby, among the laboring classes in both city and country,
brought to the table at three months old to swallow its
portion of coffee or tea; nor the small German, whom at
six months I have seen swallowing its little mug of lager
as philosophically as its serious-faced father. That these
babies have fevers and rashes, and a host of diseases
peculiar to that age, is a matter of course; and equally a
matter of course that the round-eyed mother wonders
<a name="Page_81" id="Page_81"></a>where it got its dreadful disposition, but scorns the
thought that lager or coffee can be irritants, or that the
baby stomach requires but one food, and that one the universal
food of all young animal life,&mdash;milk.</p>

<p>Take, then, our typical baby, lying fresh and sweet in
the well aired and lighted room we suppose to be his
birthright. The bones are still soft, the tender flesh and
skin with little or no power of resistance. Muscles,
nerves, all the wonderful tissues, are in process of formation;
and in the strange growth and development of this
most helpless yet most precious of all God's creations,
there are certain elements which must be had,&mdash;phosphates
to harden the delicate bones; nitrogen for flesh,
which is only developed muscle; carbon,&mdash;or sugar and
fat, which represent carbon,&mdash;for the whole wonderful
course of respiration and circulation. Water, too, must
be in abundance to fill the tiny stomach, which in the
beginning can hold but a spoonful; and to float the blood-corpuscles
through the winding channels whose mysteries,
even now, no man has fully penetrated. Caseine, which
is the solid, nourishing, cheesy part of milk, and abounds
in nitrogen, is also needed; and all the salts and alkalies
that we have found to be necessary in forming perfect
blood. Let us see if milk will meet these wants.</p>

<p>Mother's milk being nearly the same, having only a
larger proportion of water, will for the first year of our
baby's life meet every demand the system can make. Even
the first teeth are no sign, as ignorant mothers believe,
that the stomach calls for stronger food. They are known,
with reason, as milk-teeth, and the grinders delay their
appearance for months afterward. A little oatmeal, bread
and milk, and various porridges, come in here, that the
bones may harden more rapidly; but that is all. The
baby is in constant motion; and eyes and ears are taking
in the mysteries of the new life, and busy hands testing
properties, and little feet walking into mischief, all day.
This is hardly the place to dwell upon the amount of
knowledge acquired from birth to five years of age; yet
when you consider how the mind is reaching in every
direction, appropriating, investigating, drawing conclusions
which are the foundation of all our after-knowledge,
you will see that the brain is working with an intensity
never afterwards equaled; and, as brain-work means actual
destruction of brain-fiber, how vital it is that food
should be furnished in the right ratio, and made up of the
right elements!</p>

<p>With the coming of the grinders, and the call of the
<a name="Page_83" id="Page_83"></a>muscles and tissues for stronger food, begins the necessity
for a more varied dietary. Our baby now, from two and
a half to seven years of age, will require daily:&mdash;</p>

<p>This table is made from the dietaries of various children's
hospitals, where long experiment has settled the
quantities and qualities necessary to health, or, as in these
cases, recovery from sickness, at which time the appetite
is always keener.</p>

<p>In many cases physicians who have studied the laws
of food, and kept pace with modern experiments in
dietetics, strike out meat altogether till the child is
seven or eight years old, and allow it but once daily
after this time, and in very limited amount. Sir Henry
Thompson, one of the most distinguished of English
physicians, and a man noted for his popularity as diner
out and giver of dinners, writes strenuously against the
prevailing excessive use of meat, and especially protests
against its over use for children; and his opinion is shared
by most thoughtful medical men. The nitrogenous vegetables
advantageously take its place; and cheese, as
prepared after the formulas given in Mattieu Williams's
&quot;Chemistry of Cookery,&quot; is a food the value of which
we are but just beginning to appreciate.</p>

<p>As to quantity, with the healthy child, playing at will,
there need be very little restraint. Few children will eat
too much of perfectly simple food, such as this table
<a name="Page_84" id="Page_84"></a>includes. Let cake or pastry or sweetmeats enter in,
and of course, as long as the thing tastes good, the
child will beg for more. English children are confined
to this simple diet; and though of course a less
exacting climate has much to do with the greater healthfulness
of the English than the American people, the
plain but hearty and regular diet of childhood has far
more.</p>

<p>Our young American of seven, at a hotel breakfast,
would call for coffee and ham and eggs and sausages and
hot cakes. His English cousin would have no liberty to
call for anything. In fact, it is very doubtful if he would
be brought to table at all; and if there, bread and milk
or oatmeal and milk would form his meal.</p>

<p>By this time I do not doubt our baby has your heartiest
pity, and you are saying, &quot;What! no snacks? no cooky
nor cake nor candy? no running to aunt or grandmother
or tender-hearted cook for goodies? If that must be so,
half the pleasure of childhood is lost.&quot;</p>

<p>Perhaps; but suppose that with that pleasure some
other things are also lost. Suppose our baby to have
begun life with a nervous, irritable, sensitive organization,
keenly alive to pain, and this hard regimen to have covered
these nerves with firm flesh, and filled the veins with
clean, healthy blood. Suppose headache is unknown, and
loss of appetite, and a bad taste in the mouth, and all the
evils we know so well; and that work and play are easy,
and food of the simplest eaten with solid satisfaction.
The child would choose the pleasant taste, and let health
go, naturally; for a child has small reason, and life must
be ordered for it. But if the mother or father has no
sense or understanding of the laws of food, it is useless to
<a name="Page_85" id="Page_85"></a>hope for the wholesome results that under the diet of our
baby are sure to follow.</p>

<p>By seven some going to school has begun; and from
this time on the diet, while of the same general character,
may vary more from day to day. Habits of life are fixed
during this time; and even if parents dislike certain articles
of food themselves, it is well to give no sign, but as
far as possible, accustom the child to eat any wholesome
food. We are a wandering people, and sooner or later are
very likely to have circumnavigated the globe, at least in
part. Our baby must have no antipathies, but every good
thing given by Nature shall at least be tolerated. &quot;I never
eat this,&quot; or &quot;I never eat that,&quot; is a formula that no
educated person has a right to use save when some food
actually hurtful or to which he has a natural repulsion is
presented to him. Certain articles of diet are often
strangely and unaccountably harmful to some. Oysters
are an almost deadly poison to certain constitutions;
milk to others. Cheese has produced the same effect,
and even strawberries; yet all these are luxuries to the
ordinary stomach.</p>

<p>Usually the thing to guard against most carefully is
gluttony, so far as boys are concerned. With girls the
tendency often is to eat far too little. A false delicacy,
a feeling that paleness and fragility are beautiful and
feminine, inclines the young girl often to eat less than she
desires; and the stomach accustoms itself to the insufficient
supply, till the reception of a reasonable meal is an
impossibility. Or if they eat improper food (hot breads
and much fat and sweets), the same result follows.
Digestion, or rather assimilation, is impossible; and
pasty face and lusterless eyes become the rule. A greedy
<a name="Page_86" id="Page_86"></a>woman is the exception; and yet all schoolgirls know the
temptation to over-eating produced by a box of goodies
from home, or the stronger temptation, after a school-term
has ended, to ravage all cake-boxes and preserve-jars.
Then comes the pill or powder, and the habit of
going to them for a relief which if no excess had been
committed, would have been unnecessary. Patent medicines
are the natural sequence of unwholesome food, and
both are outrages on common-sense.</p>

<p>We will take it for granted, then, that our baby has
come to boyhood and youth in blissful ignorance of their
names or natures. But as we are not in the least certain
what personal tastes he may have developed, or what form
his life-work is to take,&mdash;whether professional or mercantile
or artisan in one of the many trades,&mdash;we can now
only give the regimen best adapted for each.</p>

<p>Supposing his tastes to be scholarly, and a college and
professional career to be chosen, the time has come for
slight changes in the system of diet,&mdash;very slight, however.
It has become a popular saying among thinkers
upon these questions, &quot;Without phosphorus, no thinking;&quot;
and like all arbitrary utterances it has done more
harm than good. The amount of phosphorus passing
through the system bears no relation whatever to the
intensity of thought. &quot;A captive lion,&quot; to quote from
Dr. Chambers, one of the most distinguished living authorities
on diet, &quot;a leopard, or hare, which can have
wonderfully little to think about, assimilates and parts
with a greater quantity of phosphorus than a professor of
chemistry working hard in his laboratory; while a beaver,
who always seems to be contriving something, excretes so
little phosphorus that chemical analysis cannot detect it.&quot;</p>

<p><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87"></a>Phosphatic salts are demanded, but so are other salts,
fat, and water; and the dietaries that order students to live
upon fish, eggs, and oysters, because they are rich in phosphorus,
without which the brain starves, err just so far as
they make this the sole reason,&mdash;the real reason being that
these articles are all easily digested, and that the student,
leading an inactive muscular life, does not require the
heavy, hearty food of the laborer.</p>

<p>The most perfect regimen for the intellectual life is
precisely what would be advised for the growing boy:
frequent <i>small</i> supplies of easily-digested food, that the
stomach may never be overloaded, or the brain clouded
by the fumes of half-assimilated food. If our boy trains
for a foot-race, rows with the college crew, or goes in for
base-ball, his power as a brain-worker at once diminishes.
Strong muscular action and development hinder continuous
mental work; and the literary life, as a rule, allows no
extremes, demanding only mild exercise and temperance
as its foundation-stones. But our boy can well afford to
develop his muscular system so perfectly that his mild
exercise would seem to the untrained man tolerably heavy
work.</p>

<p>The rower in a college crew requires six weeks of training
before his muscular power and endurance have reached
their height. Every particle of superfluous fat must be
removed, for fat is not strength, but weakness. There is
a vast difference between the plumpness of good muscular
development and the flabby, heavy overloading of these
muscles with rolls of fat. The chest must be enlarged,
that the lungs may have full play, and be capable of long-continued,
extra draughts upon them; and special diet
and special exercise alone can accomplish these ends.<a name="Page_88" id="Page_88"></a>
All fat-producing foods are struck out, sugar and all
starchy foods coming under this head, as well as all
puddings, pies, cakes, and sweets in general. Our boy,
after a short run, would breakfast on lean, under-done
beef or mutton, dry toast, or the crust of bread, and tea
without milk or sugar; would dine on meat and a little
bread and claret, and sup on more meat and toast, with
cresses or some acid fruit, having rowed twice over the
course in the afternoon, steadily increasing the speed, and
following it by a bath and rub. At least nine hours sleep
must be had; and with this diet, at the end of the training-time
the muscles are hard and firm, the skin wonderfully
pure and clear, and the capacity for long, steady
breathing under exertion, almost unlimited. No better
laws for the reduction of excessive fat can be laid down
for any one.</p>

<p>Under such a course, severe mental exertion is impossible;
and the return to it requires to be gradual. But
light exercise with dumb-bells, &amp;c., fresh air, walking,
and good food are the conditions of all sound mental
work, whether done by man or woman.</p>

<p>For the clerk or bookkeeper closely confined to desk or
counter, much the same regimen is needed, with brisk
exercise at the beginning and end of the day,&mdash;at least
always walking rather than riding to and from the office
or store; while in all the trades where hard labor is necessary,
heartier food must be the rule. And for all professions
or trades, the summing-up is the same: suitable
food, fresh air, sunlight, and perfect cleanliness,&mdash;the
following of these laws insuring the perfect use of every
power to the very end.</p>

<p>As old age advances, the food-demand lessens naturally.<a name="Page_89" id="Page_89"></a>
Nourishing food is still necessary, but taken in much
smaller quantities and more often, in order that the
waning powers of the stomach may not be overtaxed.
Living on such principles, work can go on till the time
for work is over, and the long sleep comes as quietly as
to a tired child. Simple common-sense and self-control
will free one once for all from the fear, too often hanging
over middle life, of a paralytic and helpless invalidism,
or the long train of apoplectic symptoms often the portion
even of middle life.</p>

<p>I omit detail as to the character and effects of tea,
coffee, alcohol, &amp;c, such details coming in the chapters
on the chemistry of food.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X" /><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90"></a>CHAPTER X.</h2>

<h2>THE CHEMISTRY OF ANIMAL FOOD.</h2>


<p>Animal food has a wider range than is usually
included under that head. The vegetarian who
announces that no animal food is allowed upon his table
offers a meal in which one finds milk, eggs, butter, and
cheese,&mdash;all forms of animal food, and all strongly
nourishing. A genuine vegetarian, if consistent, would
be forced to reject all of these; and it has already been
attempted in several large water-cures by enthusiasts who
have laid aside their common-sense, and resigned with it
some of the most essential forces for life and work.
Meat may often be entirely renounced, or eaten only at
rare intervals, with great advantage to health and working
power, but the dietary for the varied nourishment
which seems demanded must include butter, cheese, eggs,
and milk.</p>

<p>Meats will be regarded as essential by the majority,
and naturally they come first in considering food; and
beef is taken as the standard, being identical in composition
with the structures of the human body.</p>

<p>BEEF, if properly fed, is in perfection at seven years old.
It should then be a light red on the cut surface, a darker
red near the bone, and slightly marbled with fat. Beef
contains, in a hundred parts, nearly twenty of nitrogen,
<a name="Page_91" id="Page_91"></a>seventy-two of water, four of fat, and the remainder in
salts of various descriptions. The poorer the quality of
the beef, the more it will waste in cooking; and its appearance
before cooking is also very different from that of the
first quality, which, though looking moist, leaves no stain
upon the hand. In poor beef, the watery part seems to
separate from the rest, which lies in a pool of serous bloody
fluid. The gravy from such beef is pale and poor in flavor;
while the fat, which in healthy beef is firm and of a delicate
yellow, in the inferior quality is dark yellow and of rank
smell and taste. Beef is firmer in texture and more satisfying
to the stomach than any other form of meat, and is
usually considered more strengthening.</p>

<p>MUTTON is a trifle more digestible, however. A healthy
person would not notice this, the digestive power in health
being more than is necessary for the ordinary meal; but
the dyspeptic will soon find that mutton gives his stomach
less work. Its composition is very nearly the same as that
of beef; and both when cooked, either by roasting or
boiling, lose about a third of their substance, and come
to us with twenty-seven parts of nitrogen, fifteen of fat,
fifty-four of water, and three of salty matters.</p>

<p>Mountain sheep and cattle have the finest-flavored meat,
and are also richest in nitrogenous matter. The mountain
mutton of Virginia and North Carolina is as famous as
the English Southdown; but proper feeding anywhere will
make a new thing of the ordinary beef and mutton.
When our cattle are treated with decent humanity,&mdash;not
driven days with scant food and water, and then packed
into cars with no food and no water, and driven at last to
slaughter feverish and gasping in anguish that we have no
right to permit for one moment,&mdash;we may expect tender,
<a name="Page_92" id="Page_92"></a>wholesome, well-flavored meat. It is astonishing that
under present conditions it can be as good as it is.</p>

<p>In well-fed animals, the fat forms about a third of the
weight, the largest part being in the loin. In mutton, one-half
is fat; in pork, three-quarters; while poultry and
game have very little.</p>

<p>The amount of bone varies very greatly. The loin
and upper part of the leg have least; nearly half the
entire weight being in the shin, and a tenth in the carcass.
In the best mutton and pork, the bones are smaller, and
fat much greater in proportion to size.</p>

<p>VEAL and LAMB, like all young meats, are much less
digestible than beef or mutton. Both should have very
white, clear fat; and if that about the kidneys is red or
discolored, the meat should be rejected. Veal has but
sixteen parts of nitrogenous matter to sixty-three of
water, and the bones contain much more gelatine than is
found in older animals. But in all bones much useful
carbon and nitrogen is found; three pounds of bone yielding
as much carbon, and six pounds as much nitrogen, as
one pound of meat. Carefully boiled, this nutriment can
all be extracted, and flavored with vegetables, form the
basis of an endless variety of soups.</p>

<p>PORK is of all meats the most difficult to digest, containing
as it does so large a proportion of fat. In a
hundred parts of the meat, only nine of nitrogen are found,
fat being forty-eight and water thirty-nine, with but two
of salty matters. Bacon properly cured is much more
digestible than pork, the smoke giving it certain qualities
not existing in uncured pork. No food has yet been
found which can take its place for army and navy use or
in pioneering. Beef when salted or smoked loses much of
<a name="Page_93" id="Page_93"></a>its virtue, and eight ounces of fat pork will give nearly
three times as much carbon or heat-food as the same
amount of beef; but its use is chiefly for the laborer, and
it should have only occasional place in the dietary of
sedentary persons.</p>

<p>The pig is liable to many most unpleasant diseases,
measles and trichina spiralis being the most fatal to the
eaters of meat thus affected; but the last&mdash;a small animalcule
of deadly effect if taken alive into the human
stomach, as is done in eating raw ham or sausage&mdash;becomes
harmless if the same meat is long and thoroughly
boiled. Never be tempted into eating raw ham or sausage;
and in using pork in any form, try to have some
knowledge of the pig. A clean, well-fed pig in a well-kept
stye is a wonderfully different object from the
hideous beast grunting its way in many a Southern or
Western town, feeding on offal and sewage, and rolling
in filth. Such meat is unfit for human consumption, and
the eating of it insures disease.</p>

<p>We come now to another form of meat, that of edible
ENTRAILS. This includes <i>Tripe</i>, <i>Haslet</i>, or lights, &amp;c.
More nitrogen is found here than in any other portion of
the meat. The cheap and abundant supply in this country
has made us, as a people, reject all but the liver. In the
country, the sweetbreads or pancreas are often thrown
away, and tripe also. The European peasant has learned
to utilize every scrap; and while such use should not be
too strongly urged, it is certain that this meat is far better
than <i>no</i> meat. Fully one-third of the animals' weight
comes under this head,&mdash;that is, feet, tail, head, and
tongue, lungs, liver, spleen, omentum, pancreas, and
heart, together with the intestines. The rich man is
<a name="Page_94" id="Page_94"></a>hardly likely to choose much of this food, the tongue and
sweetbreads being the only dainty bits; but there are
wholesome and savory dishes to be made from every part,
and the knowledge of their preparation may be of greatest
value to a poorer neighbor. Both ox-tails and head make
excellent soup. Tripe, the inner lining of the stomach,
is, if properly prepared, not only appetizing but pleasant
to the eye. Calves' feet make good jelly; and pigs'
feet, ears, and head are soused or made into scrapple.
Blood-puddings are much eaten by Germans, but we are
not likely to adopt their use. Fresh blood has, however,
been found of wonderful effect for consumptive patients;
and there are certain slaughter-houses in our large cities
where every day pale invalids are to be found waiting for
the goblet of almost living food from the veins of the
still warm animal. Horrible as it seems, the taste for it
is soon acquired; and certainly the good results warrant
at least the effort to acquire it.</p>

<p>VENISON comes next in the order of meats, but is more
like game than any ordinary butchers' meat. It is lean,
dark in color, and savory, and if well cooked, very
digestible.</p>

<p>POULTRY are of more importance to us than game, and
the flesh, containing less nitrogen, is not so stimulating as
beef or mutton. Old fowls are often tough and indigestible,
and have often, also, a rank flavor like a close hen-house,
produced by the absorption into the flesh of the
oil intended by nature to lubricate the feathers.</p>

<p>GAME contains even less fat than poultry, and is considered
more strengthening. The flesh of rabbits and
hares is more like poultry or game than meat, but is too
close in fiber to be as digestible. Pigeons and many
<a name="Page_95" id="Page_95"></a>other birds come under none of the heads given. As a
rule, flesh is tender in proportion to the smallness of the
animal, and many varieties are eaten for the description
of which we have no room here.</p>

<p>FISH forms the only animal food for a large part of the
world. It does not possess the satisfying or stimulating
properties belonging to flesh, yet the inhabitants of fishing-towns
are shown to be unusually strong and healthy.
The flesh of some fish is white, and of others red; the red
holding much more oil, and being therefore less digestible.
In <i>Salmon</i>, the most nutritious of all fishes, there
are, in a hundred parts, sixteen of nitrogen, six of fat,
nearly two of saline matter, and seventy-seven of water.
<i>Eels</i> contain thirteen parts of fat. <i>Codfish</i>, the best-known
of all the white fish, vary greatly, according to the
time of year in which they are taken, being much more
digestible in season than out (i.e., from October to May).
<i>Mackerel</i> and <i>Herring</i> both abound in oil, the latter especially,
giving not only relish to the Irishman's potato, but
the carbon he needs as heat-food. <i>Shell-fish</i> are far less
digestible, the <i>Oyster</i> being the only exception. The nitrogenous
matter in oysters is fourteen parts, of fatty matter
one and a half, of saline matter two, and of water eighty.
At the time of spawning&mdash;from May to September&mdash;they
lose their good condition, and become unwholesome.
<i>Lobsters</i> rank next in importance, and are more delicate
and finer-flavored than <i>Crabs</i>. Both are, however, very
difficult of digestion, and should only be used occasionally.
The many forms of pickled and smoked fish are convenient,
but always less wholesome than fresh.</p>

<p>MILK comes next, and has already been considered in
a previous chapter. It is sometimes found to disagree
<a name="Page_96" id="Page_96"></a>with the stomach, but usually because looked upon as
drink and not as real food, the usual supply of which is
taken, forgetful of the fact that a glass or two of milk
contains as much nourishment as two-thirds of the average
meal. The nitrogenous matter in milk is known as
caseine, and it is this which principally forms cheese.</p>

<p>CHEESE is commonly considered only a relish, but is in
reality one of the most condensed forms of nitrogenous
food; and a growing knowledge of its value has at last
induced the Army Department to add it to the army ration
list. Mattieu Williams, after giving the chemical formulas
of caseine and the other elements of cheese, writes;
&quot;I have good and sufficient reasons for thus specifying the
properties of this constituent of food. I regard it as the
most important of all that I have to describe in connection
with my subject,&mdash;The Science of Cookery. It
contains, as I shall presently show, more nutritious material
than any other food that is ordinarily obtainable,
and its cookery is singularly neglected,&mdash;practically an
unknown art, especially in this country. We commonly
eat it raw, although in its raw state it is peculiarly indigestible,
and in the only cooked form familiarly known
among us here, that of Welsh rabbit or rare-bit, it is too
often rendered still more indigestible, though this need
not be the case. Cream-cheese is the richest form, but
keeps less well than that of milk. Stilton, the finest
English brand, is made partly of cream, partly of milk,
and so with various other foreign brands, Gruyere, &amp;c.
Parmesan is delicately flavored with fine herbs, and retains
this flavor almost unaltered by age. Our American
cheeses now rank with the best foreign ones, and will
grow more and more in favor as their value is understood,
<a name="Page_97" id="Page_97"></a>this being their strongly nitrogenous character. A cheese
of twenty pounds weight contains as much food as a sheep
weighing sixty pounds, as it hangs in the butcher's shop.
In Dutch and factory cheeses, where the curd has been precipitated
by hydrochloric acid, the food value is less than
where rennet is used; but even in this case, it is far beyond
meat in actual nutritive power.&quot;</p>

<p>BUTTER is a purely carbonaceous or heat-giving food,
being the fatty part of the milk, which rises in cream. It
is mentioned in the very earliest history, and the craving
for it seems to be universal. Abroad it is eaten without
salt; but to keep it well, salt is a necessity, and its absence
soon allows the development of a rank and unpleasant
odor. In other words, butter without it becomes rancid;
and if any particle of whey is allowed to remain in it, the
same effect takes place.</p>

<p>Perfect butter is golden in color, waxy in consistency,
and with a sweetness of odor quite indescribable, yet
unmistakable to the trained judge of butter. It possesses
the property of absorption of odors in a curious degree;
and if shut in a tight closet or a refrigerator with fish,
meat, or vegetables of rank or even pronounced smell,
exchanges its own delicate aroma for theirs, and reaches
us bereft once for all of what is the real charm of perfect
butter. For this reason absolute cleanliness and daintiness
of vessels containing milk or cream, or used in any
way in the manufacture of butter, is one of the first laws
of the dairy.</p>

<p><i>Ghee</i>, the East-Indian form of butter, is simply fresh
butter clarified by melting, and is used as a dressing for
the meal of rice. Butter, though counted as a pure fat,
is in reality made up of at least six fatty principles, there
<a name="Page_98" id="Page_98"></a>being sixty-eight per cent of margarine and thirty per cent
of oleine, the remainder being volatile compounds of fatty
acids. In the best specimens of butter there is a slight
amount of caseine, not over five per cent at most, though
in poor there is much more. It is the only fat which may
be constantly eaten without harm to the stomach, though
if not perfectly good it becomes an irritant.</p>

<p>The <i>Drippings</i> of roasted meat, more especially of beef,
rank next in value; and <i>Lard</i> comes last on the list, its
excessive use being a serious evil. Eaten constantly, as
in pastry or the New-England doughnut, it is not only
indigestible, but becomes the source of forms of scrofulous
disease. It is often a convenient substitute for butter,
but if it must be used, would better be in connection with
the harmless fat.</p>

<p>Eggs come last; and as a young animal is developed
from them, it follows that they contain all that is necessary
for animal life, though in the case of the chicken
the shell also is used, all the earthy matter being absorbed.
In a hundred parts are found fourteen of nitrogen, ten
and a half of fatty matter, one and a half of saline
matter, and seventy-four of water. Of this water the
largest part is contained in the white, which is almost
pure albumen, each particle of albumen being enclosed in
very thin-walled cells; it is the breaking of these cells
and the admission of air that enables one to beat the
white of egg to a stiff froth. The fat is accumulated in
the yolk, often amounting to thirty per cent. Raw and
lightly-boiled eggs are easy of digestion, but hard-boiled
ones decidedly not so. An egg loses its freshness within
a day or so. The shell is porous; and the always-feeding
and destroying oxygen of the air quickly gains admis<a name="Page_99" id="Page_99"></a>sion,
causing a gradual decomposition. To preserve
them, they must be coated with lard or gum, or packed
in either salt or oats, points down. In this way they
keep good a long time, and while hardly desirable to eat
as boiled eggs, answer for many purposes in cooking.</p>

<h2>THE CHEMISTRY OF VEGETABLE FOOD.</h2>


<p>We come now to the vegetable kingdom, the principal
points that we are to consider arranging themselves
somewhat as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>
Farinaceous seeds,<br />
Oleaginous seeds,<br />
Leguminous seeds,<br />
Tubers and roots,<br />
Herbaceous articles,<br />
Fruits,<br />
Saccharine and farinaceous preparations.<br />
</p>

<p>Under the first head, that of farinaceous seeds, are included
wheat, rye, oats, Indian corn, rice, and a variety
of less-known grains, all possessing in greater or less
degree the same constituents. It will be impossible to
more than touch upon many of them; and wheat must
stand as the representative, being the best-known and
most widely used of all grains. Each one is made up
of nitrogenous compounds, gluten, albumen, caseine, and
fibrine, gluten being the most valuable. Starch, dextrine,
sugar, and cellulose are also found; fatty matter, which
gives the characteristic odor of grain; mineral substances,
as phosphates of lime and magnesia, salts of potash and
soda, and silica, which we shall shortly mention again.</p>

<p><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101"></a><i>Hard Wheat</i>, or that grown in hot climates and on
fertile soil, has much more nitrogen than that of colder
countries. In hard wheat, in a hundred parts, twenty-two
will be of nitrogen, fifty-nine starch, ten dextrine,
&amp;c, four cellulose, two and a half of fatty matter, and
three of mineral, thus giving many of the constituents
found in animal food.</p>

<p>This wheat is taken as bread, white or brown, biscuits,
crackers, various preparations of the grain whether whole
or crushed, and among the Italians as <i>macaroni</i>, the most
condensed form of cereal food. The best macaroni is
made from the red wheat grown along the Mediterranean
Sea, a hot summer and warm climate producing a grain,
rich, as already mentioned, in nitrogen, and with a smaller
proportion of water than farther north. The intense
though short summer of our own far North-west seems to
bring somewhat the same result, but the outer husk is
harder. This husk was for years considered a necessity
in all really nutritious bread; and a generation of vegetarians
taking their name from Dr. Graham, and known
as Grahamites, conceived the idea of living upon the
wheaten flour in which husk and kernel were ground
together. Now, to stomachs and livers brought to great
grief by persistent pie and doughnuts and some other
New-England wickednesses, these husks did a certain
office of stimulation, stirring up jaded digestions, and
really seeming to arrest or modify long-standing dyspepsia.
But they did not know what we do, that this
outer husk is a layer of pure silica, one of the hardest
of known minerals. Boil it six weeks, and it comes
out unchanged. Boil it six years, or six centuries, and
the result would be the same. You can not stew a
<a name="Page_102" id="Page_102"></a>grindstone or bring granite to porridge, and the wheat-husk
is equally obstinate. So long as enthusiasts ate
husk and kernel ground together, little harm was done.
But when a more progressive soul declared that in bran
alone the true nutriment lay, and a host of would-be
healthier people proceeded to eat bran and preach bran,
there came a time when eating and preaching both stopped,
from sheer want of strength to go on. The enthusiasts
were literally starving themselves to death&mdash;for starvation
is by no means mere deprivation of food: on the contrary,
a man may eat heartily to the day of his death, and
feel no inconvenience, so far as any protest of the stomach
is concerned, yet the verdict of the wise physician would
be, &quot;Died of starvation.&quot; If the food was unsuitable,
and could not be assimilated, this was inevitable. Blood,
muscle, nerve&mdash;each must have its fitting food; and thus
it is easy to see why knowledge is the first condition of
healthful living. The moral is: Never rashly experiment
in diet till sure what you are about, and, if you can not for
yourselves find out the nature of your projected food, call
upon some one who can.</p>

<p>Where wheat is ground whole, it includes six and a
half parts of heat-producers to one of flesh-formers. The
amount of starch varies greatly. Two processes of making
flour are now in use,&mdash;one the old, or St. Louis process;
the other, the &quot;new process,&quot; giving Haxall flour.
In the former, grindstones were used, which often reached
so great a degree of heat as to injure the flour; and repeated
siftings gave the various grades. In the new, the outer
husk is rejected, and a system of knives is used, which
chop the grain to powder, and it is claimed do not heat it.
The product is more starchy, and for this reason less
<a name="Page_103" id="Page_103"></a>desirable. We eat far too much heat-producing food, and
any thing which gives us the gluten of the grain is more
wholesome, and thus &quot;seconds&quot; is really a more nutritious
flour than the finer grades. Try for yourselves a
small experiment, and you will learn the nature of flour
better than in pages of description.</p>

<p>Take a little flour; wet it with cold water enough to
form a dough. Place it on a sieve, and, while working it
with one hand, pour a steady stream of water over it with
another. Shortly you will find a grayish, tough, elastic
lump before you, while in the pan below, when the water
is carefully poured off, will be pure wheat-starch, the
water itself containing all the sugar, dextrine or gum,
and mineral matter. This toughness and elasticity of
gluten is an important quality; for in bread-making, were
it not for the gluten, the carbonic-acid gas formed by the
action of yeast on dough would all escape. But, though
it works its way out vigorously enough to swell up each
cell, the gluten binds it fast, and enables us to have a
panful of light &quot;sponge,&quot; where a few hours before was
only a third of a pan.</p>

<p>Starch, as you have seen, will not dissolve in the cold
water. Dry it, after the water is poured on, and minute
grains remain. Look at these grains under a microscope,
and each one is cased in a thick skin, which cold water
can not dissolve. In boiling water, the skins crack, and
the inside swells and becomes gummy. Long boiling is
thus an essential for all starchy foods.</p>

<p>Bread proper is simply flour, water, and salt, mixed to
a firm dough and baked. Such bread as this, Abram
gave to his angelic guests, and at this day the Bedouin
Arab bakes it on his heated stone. But bread, as we un<a name="Page_104" id="Page_104"></a>derstand
it, is always lightened by the addition of yeast
or some form of baking-powder, yeast making the most
wholesome as well as most palatable bread. Carbonic-acid
gas is the active agent required; and yeast so acts upon the
little starch-granules, which the microscope shows as forming
the finest flour, that this gas is formed and evenly
distributed through the whole dough. The process is
slow, and in the action some of the natural sweetness of
the flour is lost. In what is known as a&euml;rated bread,
the gas made was forced directly into the dough, by means
of a machine invented for the purpose; and a very scientific
and very good bread it is. But it demands an apparatus
not to be had save at great expense, and the older
fashions give a sufficiently sweet and desirable bread.</p>

<p><i>Rye</i> and <i>Indian Corn</i> form the next best-known varieties
of flour in bread-making; but barley and oats are
also used, and beans, pease, rice, chestnuts, in short, any
farinaceous seed, or legume rich in starch, can fill the
office.</p>

<p><i>Oatmeal</i> may take rank as one of the best and most
digestible forms of farinaceous food. Some twenty-eight
per cent of the grain is husk, seventy-two being kernel;
and this kernel forms a meal containing twelve parts of
nitrogenous matter, sixty-three of carbo-hydrates, five
and a half of fatty matter, three of saline, and fifteen of
water. So little gluten is found, that the flour of oats
can not be made into loaves of bread; although, mixed and
baked as thin cakes, it forms a large part of the Scotchman's
food. It requires thorough cooking, and is then
slightly laxative and very easily digested.</p>

<p><i>Buckwheat</i> is very rich in nitrogenous substances, and
as we eat it, in the form of cakes with butter and sirup,
<a name="Page_105" id="Page_105"></a>so heating a food, as to be only suitable for hard workers
in cold weather.</p>

<p>Indian corn has also a very small proportion of gluten,
and thus makes a bread which crumbles too readily. But
it is the favorite form of bread, not only for South and
West in our own country, but in Spanish America, Southern
Europe, Germany, and Ireland. It contains a larger
amount of fatty matter than any other grain, this making
it a necessity in fattening animals. In a hundred parts
are eleven of nitrogen, sixty-five of carbo-hydrates, eight
of fatty matter, one and a half of saline, and fourteen
of water. The large amount of fatty matter makes it
difficult to keep much meal on hand, as it grows rancid
and breeds worms; and it is best that it should be ground
in small quantities as required.</p>

<p><i>Rice</i> abounds in starch. In a hundred parts are found
seven and a half of nitrogen, eighty-eight of starch, one
of dextrine, eight-tenths of fatty matter, one of cellulose,
and nine-tenths of mineral matter. Taken alone it can
not be called a nutritive food; but eaten with butter or
milk and eggs, or as by the East Indians in curry, it holds
an important place.</p>

<p>We come now to OLEAGINOUS SEEDS; nuts, the cocoanut,
almonds, &amp;c, coming under this head. While they
are rich in oil, this very fact makes them indigestible, and
they should be eaten sparingly.</p>

<p><i>Olive-oil</i> must find mention here. No fat of either the
animal or vegetable kingdom surpasses this in delicacy
and purity. Palm-oil fills its place with the Asiatics in
part; but the olive has no peer in this respect, and we
lose greatly in our general distaste for this form of food.
The liking for it should be encouraged as decidedly as
<a name="Page_106" id="Page_106"></a>the liking for butter. It is less heating, more soothing to
the tissues, and from childhood to old age its liberal use
prevents many forms of disease, as well as equalizes digestion
in general.</p>

<p>LEGUMINOUS SEEDS are of more importance, embracing
as they do the whole tribe of beans, pease, and lentils.
Twice as much nitrogen is found in beans as in wheat;
and they rank so near to animal food, that by the addition
of a little fat they practically can take its place.
Bacon and beans have thus been associated for centuries,
and New England owes to Assyria the model for the present
Boston bean-pot. In the best table-bean, either
Lima or the butter-bean, will be found in a hundred
parts, thirty of nitrogen, fifty-six of starch, one and a
half of cellulose, two of fatty matter, three and a half
of saline, and eight and a half of water. The proportion
of nitrogen is less in pease, but about the same in
lentils. The chestnut also comes under this head, and is
largely eaten in Spain and Italy, either boiled, or dried
and ground into flour.</p>

<p>TUBERS and ROOTS follow, and of these the <i>Potato</i> leads
the van. Low as you may have noticed their standing
on the food-table to be, they are the most economical and
valuable of foods, combining as well with others, and as
little cloying to the palate, as bread itself. Each pound
of potatoes contains seven hundred and seventy grains of
carbon, and twenty-four grains of nitrogen; each pound
of wheat-flour, two thousand grains of carbon, and one
hundred and twenty of nitrogen. But the average cost
of the pound of potatoes is but one cent; that of the
pound of wheat, four. It is obtainable at all seasons, and
thus invaluable as a permanent store, though best in the
<a name="Page_107" id="Page_107"></a>winter. Spring, the germinating season, diminishes its
nutritive value. New potatoes are less nutritious than
older ones, and in cooking, if slightly underdone, are said
to satisfy the appetite better; this being the reason why
the laboring classes prefer them, as they say, &quot;with a
bone in them.&quot;</p>

<p>In a hundred parts are found but two of nitrogen,
eighteen of starch, three of sugar, two-tenths of fat,
seven-tenths of saline matter, and seventy-five parts of
water. The <i>Sweet-potato</i>, <i>Yam</i>, and <i>Artichoke</i> are all of
the same character. Other <i>Tubers</i>, the <i>Turnip</i>, <i>Beet</i>, <i>Carrot</i>,
and <i>Parsnip</i>, are in ordinary use. The turnip is nine-tenths
water, but possesses some valuable qualities. The
beet, though also largely water, has also a good deal of
sugar, and is excellent food. Carrots and parsnips are
much alike in composition. Carrots are generally rejected
as food, but properly cooked are very appetizing, their
greatest use, however, being in soups and stews.</p>

<p>HERBACEOUS ARTICLES follow; and, though we are not
accustomed to consider <i>Cabbage</i> as an herb, it began
existence as cole-wort, a shrub or herb on the south coast
of England. Cultivation has developed it into a firm
round head; and as a vegetable, abounding as it does in
nitrogen, it ranks next to beans as a food. <i>Cauliflower</i>
is a very delicate and highly prized form of cabbage, but
cabbage itself can be so cooked as to strongly resemble
it.</p>

<p><i>Onions</i> are next in value, being much milder and
sweeter when grown in a warm climate, but used chiefly
as a flavoring. <i>Lettuce</i> and <i>Celery</i> are especially valuable;
the former for salads, the latter to be eaten without
dressing though it is excellent cooked. <i>Tomatoes</i> are
<a name="Page_108" id="Page_108"></a>really a fruit, though eaten as a vegetable, and are of
especial value as a cooling food. Egg-plant, cucumbers,
&amp;c., all demand space; and so with edible fungi,
mushrooms, and truffles, the latter the property of the
epicure, and really not so desirable as that fact would
indicate.</p>

<p>FRUITS are last in order; and among these stands first
of all the apple. While in actual analysis fruits have
less nutritive value than vegetables, their acids and salts
give to them the power of counteracting the unhealthy
states brought about by the long use of dried or salted
provisions. They are a corrective also of the many evils
arising from profuse meat-eating, the citric acid of lemons
and grape-fruit being an antidote to rheumatic and gouty
difficulties. Cold storage now enables one to command
grapes long after their actual season has ended, and they
are invaluable food. The brain-worker is learning to
depend more and more on fruit in all its forms; and
apples lead the list, containing more solid nutriment than
any other form. While considered less digestible raw than
baked, they are still one of the most attractive, life-giving
forms of food, and if eaten daily would prove a standard
antidote to patent medicine. The list of fruits is too
long for mention here; but all have their specific uses,
and are necessary to perfect health.</p>

<p>SUGAR and HONEY follow in the stores of the vegetable
kingdom. Cane-sugar and glucose, or grape-sugar, are the
two recognized varieties, though the making of beet-sugar
has become an industry here as well as in France. Grape-sugar
requires to be used in five times the amount of cane,
to secure the same degree of sweetness. Honey also is a
food,&mdash;a concentrated solution of sugar, mixed with
<a name="Page_109" id="Page_109"></a>odorous, gummy, and waxy matters. It possesses much
the same food value as sugar, and is easily digested.</p>

<p>With the various FARINACEOUS PREPARATIONS, <i>Sago</i>,
<i>Tapioca</i>,<i> Arrow-root</i>, &amp;c, the vegetable dietary ends.
All are light, digestible foods, principally starchy in character,
but with little nutriment unless united with milk
or eggs. Their chief use is in the sick-room.</p>

<p>Restricted as comment must be, each topic introduced
will well reward study; and the story of each of these
varied ingredients in cookery, if well learned, will give
one an unsuspected range of thought, and a new sense of
the wealth that may be hidden in very common things.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII" /><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110"></a>CHAPTER XII.</h2>

<h2>CONDIMENTS AND BEVERAGES.</h2>


<p>Condiments are simply seasoning or flavoring
agents, and, though hardly coming under the head of
food, yet have an important part to play. As food by
their use is rendered more tempting, a larger amount is
consumed, and thus a delicate or uncertain appetite is
often aided. In some cases they have the power of correcting
the injurious character of some foods.</p>

<p>Salt stands foremost. Vinegar, lemon-juice, and pickles
owe their value to acidity; while mustard, pepper
black and red, ginger, curry-powder, and horse-radish all
depend chiefly upon pungency. Under the head of aromatic
condiments are ranged cinnamon, nutmegs, cloves,
allspice, mint, thyme, fennel, sage, parsley, vanilla, leeks,
onions, shallots, garlic, and others, all of them entering
into the composition of various sauces in general use.</p>

<p>Salt is the one thing indispensable. The old Dutch law
condemned criminals to a diet of unsalted food, the effects
being said to be those of the severest physical torture.
Years ago an experiment tried near Paris demonstrated
the necessity of its use. A number of cattle were fed
without the ration of salt; an equal number received it
regularly. At the end of a specified time, the unsalted
animals were found rough of coat, the hair falling off in
<a name="Page_111" id="Page_111"></a>spots, the eyes wild, and the flesh hardly half the amount
of those naturally fed.</p>

<p>A class of extreme Grahamites in this country decry
the use of salt, as well as of any form of animal food; and
I may add that the expression of their thought in both
written and spoken speech is as savorless as their diet.</p>

<p>Salt exists, as we have already found, in the blood:
the craving for it is a universal instinct, even buffaloes
making long journeys across the plains to the salt-licks;
and its use not only gives character to insipid food, but
increases the flow of the gastric juice.</p>

<p>Black pepper, if used profusely as is often done in
American cooking, becomes an irritant, and produces indigestion.
Red pepper, or cayenne, on the contrary, is a
useful stimulant at times; but, as with mustard, any over-use
irritates the lining of the stomach.</p>

<p>So with spices and sweet herbs. There should be only
such use of them as will flavor well, delicately, and almost
imperceptibly. No one flavor should predominate, and
only a sense of general savoriness rule. Extracts, as of
vanilla, lemon, bitter almond, &amp;c., should be used with
the greatest care, and if possible always be added to an
article after it cools, as the heat wastes the strength.</p>


<p>BEVERAGES.</p>

<p>Tea and coffee are the most universal drinks, after water.
The flavor of both is due to a principle, <i>theine</i> in tea,
<i>caffeine</i> in coffee, in which both the good and the ill effects
of these drinks are bound up. It is hardly necessary the
principles should have different names, as they have been
found by chemists to be identical; the essential spirit of
cocoa and chocolate,&mdash;<i>theobromine</i>,&mdash;though not identical,
having many of the same properties.</p>

<p><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112"></a><i>Tea</i> is valuable chiefly for its warming and comforting
qualities. Taken in moderation, it acts partly as a sedative,
partly as a stimulant, arresting the destruction of
tissue, and seeming to invigorate the whole nervous system.
The water in it, even if impure, is made wholesome
by boiling, and the milk and sugar give a certain
amount of real nourishment. Nervous headaches are
often cured by it, and it has, like coffee, been used as an
antidote in opium-poisoning.</p>

<p>Pass beyond the point of moderation, and it becomes
an irritant, precisely in the same way that an overdose of
morphine will, instead of putting to sleep, for just so much
longer time prevent any sleep at all. The woman who
can not eat, and who braces her nerves with a cup of green
tea,&mdash;the most powerful form of the herb,&mdash;is doing a
deeper wrong than she may be able to believe. The immediate
effect is delightful. Lightness, exhilaration, and
sense of energy are all there; but the re-action comes
surely, and only a stronger dose next time accomplishes
the end desired. Nervous headaches, hysteria in its
thousand forms, palpitations, and the long train of nervous
symptoms, own inordinate tea and coffee drinking as their
parent. Taken in reasonable amounts, tea can not be said
to be hurtful; and the medium qualities, carefully prepared,
often make a more wholesome tea than that of the
highest price, the harmful properties being strongest in
the best. If the water is soft, it should be used as soon
as boiled, boiling causing all the gases which give flavor
to water to escape. In hard water, boiling softens it. In
all cases the water must be fresh, and poured boiling upon
the proper portion of tea,&mdash;the teapot having first been
well scalded with boiling water. Never boil any tea but<a name="Page_113" id="Page_113"></a>
English-breakfast tea; for all others, simple steeping gives
the drink in perfection.</p>

<p>A disregard of these rules gives one the rank, black,
unpleasant infusion too often offered as tea; while, if
boiled in tin, it becomes a species of slow poison,&mdash;the
tannic acid in the tea acting upon the metal, and producing
a chemical compound whose character it is hard
to determine. Various other plants possess the essential
principle of tea, and are used as such; as in Paraguay,
where the Brazilian holly is dried, and makes a tea very
exhilarating in quality, but much more astringent.</p>

<p>The use of <i>Coffee</i> dates back even farther than that of
tea. Of the many varieties, Mocha and Java are finest in
flavor, and a mixture of one-third Mocha with two-thirds
Java gives the drink at its best. As in tea, there are three
chief constituents: (1) A volatile oil, giving the aroma
it possesses, but less in amount than that in tea. (2)
Astringent matter,&mdash;a modification of tannin, but also
less than in tea. (3) Caffeine, now found identical with
theine, but varying in amount in different varieties of coffee,&mdash;being
in some three or four per cent, in others less.</p>

<p>The most valuable property of coffee is its power of
relieving the sensation of hunger and fatigue. To the
soldier on active service, nothing can take its place; and
in our own army it became the custom often, not only to
drink the infusion, but, if on a hard march, to eat the
grounds also. In all cases it diminishes the waste of
tissue. In hot weather it is too heating and stimulating,
acting powerfully upon the liver, and, by producing over-activity
of that organ, bringing about a general disturbance.</p>

<p>So many adulterations are found in ground coffee, that it
<a name="Page_114" id="Page_114"></a>is safest for the real coffee-lover to buy the bean whole.
Roasting is usually more perfectly done at the grocers', in
their rotary roasters, which give every grain its turn; but,
by care and constant stirring, it can be accomplished at
home. Too much boiling dissipates the delicious aroma
we all know; and the best methods are considered to be
those which allow no boiling, after boiling water has been
poured upon it, but merely a standing, to infuse and
settle. The old fashion, however, of mixing with an egg,
and boiling a few minutes, makes a coffee hardly inferior
in flavor. In fact, the methods are many, but results,
under given conditions, much the same; and we may
choose urn, or old-fashioned tin pot, or a French biggin,
with the certainty that good coffee, well roasted, boiling
water, and good judgment as to time, will give always
a delicious drink. Make a note of the fact that long
boiling sets free tannic acid, powerful enough to literally
tan the coats of the stomach, and bring on incurable dyspepsia.
Often coffee without milk can be taken, where,
with milk, it proves harmful; but, in all cases, moderation
must rule. Taken too strong, palpitation of the heart,
vertigo, and fainting are the usual consequences.</p>

<p><i>Cocoa</i>, or, literally, cacao, from the cacao-tree, comes
in the form of a thick seed, twenty or thirty of which
make up the contents of a gourd-like fruit, the spaces between
being filled with a somewhat acid pulp. The seeds,
when freed from this pulp by various processes, are first
dried in the sun, and then roasted; and from these roasted
seeds come various forms of cocoa.</p>

<p><i>Cocoa-shells</i> are the outer husk, and by long boiling
yield a pleasant and rather nutritious drink. Cocoa itself
is the nut ground to powder, and sometimes mixed with
sugar, the husk being sometimes ground with it.</p>

<p><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115"></a>In <i>Chocolate</i>&mdash;a preparation of cocoa&mdash;the cocoa is
carefully dried and roasted, and then ground to a smooth
paste, the nuts being placed on a hot iron plate, and so
keeping the oily matter to aid in forming a paste. Sugar
and flavorings, as vanilla, are often added, and the whole
pressed into cakes. The whole substance of the nut
being used, it is exceedingly nutritious, and made more
so by the milk and sugar added. Eaten with bread it
forms not only a nourishing but a hearty meal; and so
condensed is its form, that a small cake carried in traveling,
and eaten with a cracker or two, will give temporarily
the effect of a full meal.</p>

<p>In a hundred parts of chocolate are found forty-eight of
fatty matter or cocoa-butter, twenty-one of nitrogenous
matter, four of theobromine, eleven of starch, three of cellulose,
three of mineral matter, and ten of water; there
being also traces of coloring matter, aromatic essence, and
sugar. Twice as much nitrogenous, and twenty-five times
as much fatty matter as wheaten flour, make it a valuable
food, though the excess of fat will make it disagree with
a very delicate stomach.</p>

<p><i>Alcohol</i> is last upon our list, and scientific men are
still uncertain whether or not it can in any degree be considered
as a food; but we have no room for the various
arguments for and against. You all know, in part at least,
the effects of intemperance; and even the moderate daily
drinker suffers from clouded mind, irritable nerves, and
ruined digestion.</p>

<p>This is not meant as an argument for total abstinence;
but there are cases where such abstinence is the only rule.
In an inherited tendency to drink, there is no other safe
road; but to the man or woman who lives by law, and
<a name="Page_116" id="Page_116"></a>whose body is in the best condition, wine in its many
forms is a permissible <i>occasional</i> luxury, and so with beer
and cider and the wide range of domestic drinks. In old
age its use is almost essential, but always in moderation,
individual temperament modifying every rule, and making
the best knowledge an imperative need. A little alcoholic
drink increases a delicate appetite: a great deal diminishes
or takes it away entirely, and also hinders and in many
cases stops digestion altogether. In its constant over-use
the membranes of the stomach are gradually destroyed,
and every organ in the body suffers. In ales and beers
there is not only alcohol, but much nitrogenous and sugary
matter, very fattening in its nature. A light beer, well
flavored with hops, is an aid to digestion, but taken in
excess produces biliousness. The long list of alcoholic
products it is not necessary to give, nor is it possible to
enter into much detail regarding alcohol itself; but there
are one or two points so important that they can not be
passed by.</p>

<p>You will recall in a preceding chapter the description of
the circulation of the blood, and of its first passage through
veins and arteries for cleansing, before a second round
could make it food for the whole complex nervous system.
Alcohol taken in excess, it has been proved in countless
experiments by scientific men, possesses the power of
coagulating the blood. The little corpuscles adhere in
masses, and cannot force themselves through the smaller
vessels, and circulation is at once hindered. This, however,
is the secondary stage. At first, as many of you
have had occasion to notice, the face flushes, the eyes
grow brighter, and thought and word both come more
freely. The heart beats far more rapidly, and the speed
<a name="Page_117" id="Page_117"></a>increases in proportion to the amount of alcohol absorbed.
The average number of beats of the heart, allowing for
its slower action during sleep, is 100,000 beats per day.
Under a small supply of alcohol this rose to 127,000, and
in actual intoxication to 131,000.</p>

<p>The flush upon the cheek is only a token of the same
fact within; every organ is congested. The brain has
been examined under such circumstances, and &quot;looked as
if injected with vermilion ... the membrane covering
both brains resembling a delicate web of coagulated red
blood, so tensely were its fine vessels engorged.&quot;</p>

<p>At a later stage the muscular power is paralyzed, the
rule of mind over body suspended, and a heavy, brutal
sleep comes, long or short according to the amount taken.
This is the extreme of alcoholism, and death the only
ending to it, as a habitual condition. Alcohol seems a
necessary evil; for that its occasional beneficence can
modify or neutralize the long list of woe and crime and
brutality following in its train, is more than doubtful.</p>

<p>&quot;Whatever good can come from alcohol, or whatever
evil, is all included in that primary physiological and luxurious
action of the agent upon the nervous supply of the
circulation.... If it be really a luxury for the heart to
be lifted up by alcohol, for the blood to course more
swiftly through the brain, for the thoughts to flow more
vehemently, for words to come more fluently, for emotions
to rise ecstatically, and for life to rush on beyond the pace
set by nature; then those who enjoy the luxury must
enjoy it&mdash;with the consequences.&quot;</p>

<p>And now, at the end of our talks together, friends, there
is yet another word. Much must remain unsaid in these
narrow limits; but they are wide enough, I hope, to have
<a name="Page_118" id="Page_118"></a>given the key by which you may find easy entrance to the
mysteries we all may know, indeed must, if our lives are
truly lived. If through intemperance, in meat or drink,
in feeling or thought, you lessen bodily or mental power,
you alone are accountable, whether ignorant or not. Only
in a never-failing self-control can safety ever be. Temperance
is the foundation of high living; and here is its definition,
by one whose own life holds it day by day:&mdash;</p>

<p>&quot;Temperance is personal cleanliness; is modesty; is
quietness; is reverence for one's elders and betters; is
deference to one's mother and sisters; is gentleness;
is courage; is the withholding from all which leads to
excess in daily living; is the eating and drinking only
of that which will insure the best body which the best
soul is to inhabit: nay, temperance is all these, and
more.&quot;</p>

<h2><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119"></a><i>PART II.</i></h2>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="STOCK_AND_SEASONING" id="STOCK_AND_SEASONING" />STOCK AND SEASONING.</h2>


<p>The preparation called STOCK is for some inscrutable
reason a stumbling-block to average cooks, and even
by experienced housekeepers is often looked upon as
troublesome and expensive. Where large amounts of
fresh meat are used in its preparation, the latter adjective
might be appropriate; but stock in reality is the only mode
by which every scrap of bone or meat, whether cooked or
uncooked, can be made to yield the last particle of nourishment
contained in it. Properly prepared and strained
into a stone jar, it will keep a week, and is as useful in
the making of hashes and gravies as in soup itself.</p>

<p>The first essential is a tightly-covered kettle, either
tinned iron or porcelain-lined, holding not less than two
gallons; three being a preferable size. Whether cooked
or uncooked meat is used, it should be cut into small bits,
and all bones broken or sawn into short pieces, that the
marrow may be easily extracted.</p>

<p>To every pound of meat and bone allow one quart of
cold water, one even teaspoon of salt, and half a saltspoon
of pepper. Let the meat stand till the water is
slightly colored with its juice; then put upon the fire, and
let it come slowly to a boil, skimming off every particle
<a name="Page_120" id="Page_120"></a>of scum as it rises. The least neglect of this point will
give a broth in which bits of dark slime float about, unpleasant
to sight and taste. A cup of cold water, thrown
in as the kettle boils, will make the scum rise more freely.
Let it boil steadily, but very slowly, allowing an hour to
each pound of meat. The water will boil away, leaving,
at the end of the time specified, not more than half or
one-third the original amount. In winter this will become
a firm jelly, which can be used by simply melting it, thus
obtaining a strong, clear broth; or can be diluted with an
equal quantity of water, and vegetables added for a vegetable
soup.</p>

<p>The meat used in stock, if boiled the full length of time
given, has parted with all its juices, and is therefore useless
as food. If wanted for hashes or croquettes, the portion
needed should be taken out as soon as tender, and a
pint of the stock with it, to use as gravy. Strain, when
done, into a stone pot or crock kept for the purpose, and,
when cold, remove the cake of fat which will rise to the
top. This fat, melted and strained, serves for many purposes
better than lard. If the stock is to be kept several
days, leave the fat on till ready to use it.</p>

<p>Fresh and cooked meat may be used together, and all
remains of poultry or game, and trimmings of chops and
steaks, may be added, mutton being the only meat which
can not as well be used in combination; though even this,
by trimming off all the fat, may also be added. If it is
intended to keep the stock for some days, no vegetables
should be added, as vegetable juices ferment very easily.
For clear soups they must be cooked with the meat; and
directions will be given under that head for amounts and
seasonings.</p>

<p><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121"></a>The secret of a savory soup lies in many flavors, none
of which are allowed to predominate; and, minutely as
rules for such flavoring may be given, only careful and
frequent <i>tasting</i> will insure success. Every vegetable,
spice, and sweet herb, curry-powders, catchups, sauces,
dried or fresh lemon-peel, can be used; and the simple
stock, by the addition of these various ingredients, becomes
the myriad number of soups to be found in the
pages of great cooking manuals like Gouff&eacute;e's or Francatelli's.</p>

<p><i>Brown soups</i> are made by frying the meat or game used
in them till thoroughly brown on all sides, and using dark
spices or sauces in their seasoning.</p>

<p><i>White soups</i> are made with light meats, and often with
the addition of milk or cream.</p>

<p><i>Pur&eacute;es</i> are merely thick soups strained carefully before
serving, and made usually of some vegetable which
thickens in boiling, as beans, pease, &amp;c, though there are
several forms of fish <i>pur&eacute;es</i> in which the foundation is
thickened milk, to which the fish is added, and the whole
then rubbed through a common sieve, if a regular pur&eacute;e-sieve
is not to be had.</p>

<p>Browned flour is often used for coloring, but does not
thicken a soup, as, in browning it, the starchy portion has
been destroyed; and it will not therefore mix, but settles
at the bottom. Burned sugar or caramel makes a better
coloring, and also adds flavor. With clear soups grated
cheese is often served, either Parmesan or any rich cheese
being used. Onions give a better flavor if they are fried
in a little butter or dripping before using, and many professional
cooks fry all soup vegetables lightly. Cabbage
and potatoes should be parboiled in a separate water be<a name="Page_122" id="Page_122"></a>fore
adding to a soup. In using wine or catchup, add
only at the last moment, as boiling dissipates the flavor.
Unless a thick vegetable soup is desired, always strain into
the tureen. Rice, sago, macaroni, or any cereal may be
used as thickening; the amounts required being found
under the different headings. Careful skimming, long
boiling, and as careful removing of fat, will secure a
broth especially desirable as a food for children and the
old, but almost equally so for any age; while many fragments,
otherwise entirely useless, discover themselves as
savory and nutritious parts of the day's supply of food.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<h2><a name="SOUPS" id="SOUPS" />SOUPS.</h2>


<p>BEEP SOUP WITH VEGETABLES.</p>

<p>For this very excellent soup take two quarts of stock
prepared beforehand, as already directed. If the stock
is a jelly, as will usually be the case in winter, an amount
sufficient to fill a quart-measure can be diluted with a
pint of water, and will then be rich enough. Add to
this one small carrot, a turnip, a small parsnip, and two
onions, all chopped fine; a cupful of chopped cabbage;
two tablespoonfuls of barley or rice; and either six fresh
tomatoes sliced, or a small can of sealed ones. Boil
gently at least one hour; then add one saltspoonful each
of pepper, curry-powder, and clove. If the stock has
been salted properly, no more will be needed; but tasting
is essential to secure just the right flavors. Boil a few
minutes longer, and serve without straining.</p>

<p><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123"></a>This is an especially savory and hearty soup, and the
combinations of vegetables may be varied indefinitely. A
cup of chopped celery is an exceedingly nice addition, or,
if this is not to be had, a teaspoonful of celery salt, or a
saltspoonful of celery-seed. A lemon may also be sliced
thin, and added at the last. Where tomatoes are used, a
little sugar is always an improvement; in this case an
even tablespoonful being sufficient. If a thicker broth is
desired, one heaped tablespoonful of corn-starch or flour
may be first dissolved in a little cold water; then a cup of
the hot broth gradually mixed with it, and the whole added
to the soup and boiled for five minutes.</p>


<p>CLEAR OR AMBER SOUP.</p>

<p>This soup needs careful attention. It may be made of
beef alone, but, if desired very rich for a special dinner,
requires the addition of either a chicken or a knuckle of
veal. Allow, then, for the best soup, a soup-bone,&mdash;the
shin of beef being most desirable,&mdash;weighing from two to
three pounds; a chicken; a slice of fat ham; two onions,
each stuck with three cloves; one small carrot and parsnip;
one stalk of celery; one tablespoonful of salt; half
a saltspoonful of pepper; and four quarts of cold water.</p>

<p>Cut all the meat from the beef bone in small pieces;
slice the onions; fry the ham (or, if preferred, a thick
slice of salt pork weighing not less than two ounces);
fry the onions a bright brown in this fat; add the pieces
of beef, and brown them also. Now put all the materials,
bones included, into the soup-kettle; add the cold water,
and let it very gradually come to a boil. Skim with the
utmost care, and then boil slowly and steadily for not less
than five hours, six or even seven being preferable.<a name="Page_124" id="Page_124"></a>
Strain, and set in a cold place. Next day remove the fat,
and put the soup on the fire one hour before it will be
wanted. Break the white and shell of an egg into a
bowl; add a spoonful of cold water, and beat a moment;
add a little of the hot soup, that the white may mix more
thoroughly with the soup, and then pour it into the kettle.
Let all boil slowly for ten minutes; then strain, either
through a jelly-bag, or through a thick cloth laid in a
sieve or colander. Do not stir, as this would cloud the
soup; and, if not clear and sparkling, strain again. Return
to the fire, and heat to boiling-point, putting a lemon
cut in thin slices, and, if liked, a glass of sherry, into the
tureen before serving. A poached egg, or a boiled egg
from which the shell has been peeled, is often served with
each plate of this soup, which must be clear to deserve its
name.</p>


<p>WHITE SOUP.</p>

<p>Veal or chicken must be used for this soup; and the
stock must always be prepared the day beforehand, having
been flavored with two chopped onions and a cup of cut
celery, or celery-seed and other seasoning, in the proportions
already given. On the day it is to be used, heat a
quart of milk; stir one tablespoonful of butter to a cream;
add a heaping tablespoonful of flour or corn-starch, a
saltspoonful of mace, and the same amount of white
pepper. Stir into the boiling milk, and add to the soup.
Let all boil a moment, and then pour into the tureen.
Three eggs, beaten very light and stirred into the hot milk
without boiling, make a still richer soup. The bones of
cold roast chicken or turkey may be used in this way; and
the broth of any meat, if perfectly clear, can serve as
foundation, though veal or chicken is most delicate.<a name="Page_125" id="Page_125"></a></p>


<p>MOCK TURTLE SOUP.</p>

<p>A calf's head is usually taken for this soup; but a set
of calf's feet and a pound of lean veal answer equally
well. In either case, boil the meat in four quarts of water
for five hours, reducing the amount to two quarts, and
treating as stock for clear soup.</p>

<p>Remove all fat, and put on the fire next day, half an
hour before dinner, seasoning it with a saltspoonful each
of mace, powdered thyme, or sweet marjoram and clove.
Melt a piece of butter the size of a walnut in a small
saucepan; add a heaping tablespoonful of flour, and stir
both till a bright brown. Add soup till a smooth thickening
is made, and pour it into the soup-kettle. Cut about
half a pound of the cold meat into small square pieces,&mdash;<i>dice</i>
they are called,&mdash;and put into the tureen. Make
forcemeat balls by chopping a large cup of meat very fine;
season with a saltspoonful each of pepper and thyme;
mix in the yolk of a raw egg; make into little balls the
size of a hickory-nut, and fry brown in a little butter.
Squeeze the juice of half a lemon into the tureen with (or
without) a wine-glass of sherry. Pour in the soup, and
serve. If egg-balls are desired, make them of the yolks
of two hard-boiled eggs rubbed fine. Add the yolk of a
raw egg, a tablespoonful of melted butter, a saltspoon
of salt and half a one of pepper, and flour enough to
make a dough which can be easily handled. Roll out;
cut into little dice, and make each into a ball by rolling
between the palms of the hands. Boil five minutes in the
soup.</p>


<p>MUTTON BROTH.</p>

<p>Prepare and boil as directed for stock. The broth
from a boiled leg of mutton can be used, or any cheap
<a name="Page_126" id="Page_126"></a>pieces and trimmings from chops. One small turnip and
an onion will give flavoring enough. On the day it is to
be used, add to two quarts of broth half a cup of rice,
and boil for half an hour.</p>


<p>CHICKEN BROTH.</p>

<p>Even an old fowl which is unusable in any other way
makes excellent broth. Prepare as in any stock, and,
when used, add a tablespoonful of rice to each quart of
broth, boiling till tender. A white soup will be found the
most savory mode of preparation, the plain broth with
rice being best for children and invalids.</p>


<p>TOMATO SOUP WITHOUT MEAT.</p>

<p>Materials for this soup are: one large can, or twelve
fresh tomatoes; one quart of boiling water; two onions;
a small carrot; half a small turnip; two or three sprigs
of parsley, or a stalk of celery,&mdash;all cut fine, and boiled
one hour. As the water boils away, add more to it,
so that the quantity may remain the same. Season with
one even tablespoonful each of salt and sugar, and half
a teaspoonful of pepper. Cream a tablespoonful of butter
with two heaping ones of flour, and add hot soup till
it will pour easily. Pour into the soup; boil all together
for five minutes; then strain through a sieve, and serve
with toasted crackers or bread.</p>


<p>HASTY TOMATO SOUP.</p>

<p>Simple but excellent. One large can of tomatoes and
one pint of water brought to the boiling-point, and
rubbed through a sieve. Return to the fire. Add half a
teaspoonful of soda, and stir till it stops foaming. Sea<a name="Page_127" id="Page_127"></a>son
with one even tablespoonful of salt, two of sugar,
one saltspoonful of cayenne. Thicken with two heaping
tablespoonfuls of flour, and one of butter rubbed to a
cream, with hot soup added till it pours easily. Boil a pint
of milk separately, and, when ready to use, pour into the
boiling tomato, and serve at once, as standing long makes
the milk liable to curdle.</p>


<p>OYSTER SOUP.</p>

<p>Two quarts of perfectly fresh oysters. Strain off the
juice, and add an equal amount of water, or, if they are
solid, add one pint of water, and then strain and boil.
Skim carefully. Add to one quart of milk one tablespoonful
of salt, and half a teaspoonful of pepper, and, if
thickening is liked, use same proportions as in hasty tomato
soup, and set to boil. When the milk boils, put in the
oysters. The moment the edges curl a little, which will
be when they have boiled one minute, they are done, and
should be served at once. Longer boiling toughens and
spoils them. This rule may be used also for stewed oysters,
omitting the thickening; or they may be put simply
into the boiling juice, with the same proportions of butter,
salt, and pepper, and cooked the same length of time.</p>


<p>CLAM SOUP.</p>

<p>Fifty clams (hard or soft), boiled in a quart of water
one hour. Take out, and chop fine. Add one quart of
milk, half a teaspoonful of pepper, and one teaspoonful
of salt. It will be necessary to taste, however, as some
clams are salter than others. Rub one tablespoonful of
butter to a cream with two of flour, and use as thickening.
Add the chopped clams, and boil five minutes. If the
<a name="Page_128" id="Page_128"></a>clams are disliked, simply strain through a sieve, or cut
off the hard part and use the soft only.</p>


<p>PUR&Eacute;E, OF FISH, VEGETABLES, ETC.</p>

<p>One pound of fresh boiled salmon, or one small can of
the sealed.</p>

<p>Pick out all bone and skin, and, if the canned is used,
pour off every drop of oil. Shred it as fine as possible.
Boil one quart of milk, seasoning with one teaspoonful
of salt, and one saltspoonful each of mace and white
pepper, increasing the amount slightly if more is liked.
Thicken with two tablespoonfuls of flour, and one of butter
rubbed to a cream, with a cup of boiling water; add
thickening and salmon, and boil two minutes. Strain into
the tureen through a pur&eacute;e sieve, rubbing as much as possible
of the salmon through with a potato-masher, and
<i>serve very hot</i>. All that will not go through can be mixed
with an equal amount of cracker-crumbs or mashed potato,
made into small cakes or rolls, and fried in a little
butter for breakfast, or treated as croquettes, and served
at dinner.</p>

<p>This thickened milk is the foundation for many forms of
fish and vegetable pur&eacute;es. A pint of green pease, boiled,
mashed, and added; or asparagus or spinach in the same
proportions can be used. <i>Lobster</i> makes a pur&eacute;e as delicious
as that of salmon. Dry the &quot;coral&quot; in the oven;
pound it fine, and add to the milk before straining, thus
giving a clear pink color. Cut all the meat and green fat
into dice, and put into the tureen, pouring the hot milk
upon it. Boiled <i>cod</i> or <i>halibut</i> can be used; but nothing is
so nice as the salmon, either fresh or canned. For a <i>Pur&eacute;e
of Celery</i> boil one pint of cut celery in water till tender;
<a name="Page_129" id="Page_129"></a>then add to boiling milk, and rub through the sieve.
For <i>Potato Pur&eacute;e</i> use six large or ten medium sized potatoes,
boiled and mashed fine; then stirred into the milk,
and strained; a large tablespoonful of chopped parsley
being put in the tureen. For a <i>Green-Corn Soup</i> use the
milk without straining; adding a can of corn, or the corn
cut from six ears of fresh boiled corn, and an even tablespoonful
of sugar, and boiling ten minutes. <i>Salsify</i> can
also be used, the combinations being numberless, and
one's own taste a safe guide in making new ones.</p>


<p>TURTLE-BEAN SOUP.</p>

<p>Wash and soak over-night, in cold water, one pint
of the black or turtle beans. In the morning put on
the fire in three quarts of cold water, which, as it boils
away, must be added to, to preserve the original quantity.
Add quarter of a pound of salt pork and half a pound
of lean beef; one carrot and two onions cut fine; one
tablespoonful of salt; one saltspoonful of cayenne. Cover
closely, and boil four or five hours. Rub through a colander,
having first put in the tureen three hard-boiled eggs
cut in slices, one lemon sliced thin, and half a glass of
wine. This soup is often served with small sausages
which have been boiled in it for ten minutes, and then
skinned, and used either whole or cut in bits. Cold baked
beans can also be used, in which case the meat, eggs, and
wine are omitted.</p>


<p>PEA SOUP.</p>

<p>One quart of dried pease, washed and soaked over-night;
split pease are best. In the morning put them on
the fire with six quarts of cold water; half a pound of
salt pork; one even tablespoonful of salt; one saltspoonful
<a name="Page_130" id="Page_130"></a>of cayenne; and one teaspoonful of celery-seed. Fry till a
bright brown three onions cut small, and add to the pease;
cover closely, and boil four or five hours. Strain through
a colander, and, if not perfectly smooth, return to fire,
and add a thickening made of one heaping teaspoonful of
flour and an even one of butter, stirred together with a
little hot water and boiled five minutes. Beans can be
used in precisely the same way; and both bean and pea
soups are nicer served with <i>croutons</i>, or a thick slice of
bread cut in dice, and fried brown and crisp, or simply
browned in the oven, and put into the tureen at the
moment of serving.</p>


<p>ONION SOUP.</p>

<p>Take three large onions, slice them very thin, and then
fry to a bright brown in a large spoonful of either butter
or stock-fat, the latter answering equally well. When
brown, add half a teacupful of flour, and stir constantly
until red. Then pour in slowly one pint of boiling water,
stirring steadily till it is all in. Boil and mash fine four
large potatoes, and stir into one quart of boiling milk,
taking care that there are no lumps. Add this to the fried
onions, with one teaspoonful of salt and half a teaspoonful
of white pepper. Let all boil for five minutes, and then
serve with toasted or fried bread. Simple as this seems,
it is one of the best of the vegetable soups, though it is
made richer by the use of stock instead of water.</p>


<p>BROWNED FLOUR FOR SOUPS.</p>

<p>Put a pint of sifted flour into a perfectly clean frying-pan,
and stir and turn constantly as it darkens, till the
whole is an even dark brown. If scorched at all, it is
<a name="Page_131" id="Page_131"></a>ruined, and should not be used for any purpose. As a
coloring for soups and gravies it is by no means as good
as caramel or burned sugar.</p>


<p>CARAMEL.</p>

<p>Half a pound of brown sugar; one tablespoonful of
water. Put into a frying-pan, and stir steadily over the
fire till it becomes a deep dark brown in color. Then add
one cup of boiling water and one teaspoonful of salt.
Boil a minute longer, bottle, and keep corked. One
tablespoonful will color a clear soup, and it can be used
for many jellies, gravies, and sauces.</p>

<h2><a name="FISH" id="FISH" />FISH.</h2>


<p>The most essential point in choosing fish is their <i>freshness</i>,
and this is determined as follows: if the gills are
red, the eyes prominent and full, and the whole fish stiff,
they are good; but if the eyes are sunken, the gills pale,
and the fish flabby, they are stale and unwholesome, and,
though often eaten in this condition, lack all the fine flavor
of a freshly-caught fish.</p>

<p>The fish being chosen, the greatest care is necessary in
cleaning. If this is properly done, one washing will be
sufficient: the custom of allowing fresh fish to lie in water
after cleaning, destroys much of their flavor.</p>

<p>Fresh-water fish, especially the cat-fish, have often a
muddy taste and smell. To get rid of this, soak in water
strongly salted; say, a cupful of salt to a gallon of water,
<a name="Page_132" id="Page_132"></a>letting it heat gradually in this, and boiling it for one
minute; then drying it thoroughly before cooking.</p>

<p>All fish for boiling should be put into cold water, with
the exception of salmon, which loses its color unless put
into boiling water. A tablespoonful each of salt and
vinegar to every two quarts of water improves the flavor
of all boiled fish, and also makes the flesh firmer. Allow
ten minutes to the pound after the fish begins to boil, and
test with a knitting-needle or sharp skewer. If it runs in
easily, the fish can be taken off. If a fish-kettle with
strainer is used, the fish can be lifted out without danger
of breaking. If not, it should be thoroughly dredged
with flour, and served in a cloth kept for the purpose. In
all cases drain it perfectly, and send to table on a folded
napkin laid upon the platter.</p>

<p>In frying, fish should, like all fried articles, be <i>immersed</i>
in the hot lard or drippings. Small fish can be fried
whole; larger ones boned, and cut in small pieces. If
they are egged and crumbed, the <i>egg</i> will form a covering,
hardening at once, and absolutely impervious to fat.</p>

<p>Pan-fish, as they are called,&mdash;flounders and small fish
generally,&mdash;can also be fried by rolling in Indian meal or
flour, and browning in the fat of salt pork.</p>

<p>Baking and broiling preserve the flavor most thoroughly.</p>

<p>Cold boiled fish can always be used, either by spicing
as in the rule to be given, or by warming again in a little
butter and water. Cold fried or broiled fish, can be put in
a pan, and set in the oven till hot, this requiring not over
ten minutes; a longer time giving a strong, oily taste,
which spoils it. Plain boiled or mashed potatoes are
always served with fish where used as a dinner-course. If
<a name="Page_133" id="Page_133"></a>fish is boiled whole, do not cut off either tail or head. The
tail can be skewered in the mouth if liked; or a large fish
may be boiled in the shape of the letter S by threading a
trussing-needle, fastening a string around the head, then
passing the needle through the middle of the body, drawing
the string tight and fastening it around the tail.</p>


<p>BAKED FISH.</p>

<p>Bass, fresh shad, blue-fish, pickerel, &amp;c., can be cooked
in this way:&mdash;</p>

<p>See that the fish has been properly cleaned. Wash in
salted water, and wipe dry. For stuffing for a fish weighing
from four to six pounds, take four large crackers, or
four ounces of bread-crumbs; quarter of a pound of salt
pork; one teaspoonful of salt, and half a teaspoonful of
pepper; a tablespoonful of chopped parsley, or a teaspoonful
of thyme. Chop half the pork fine, and mix with the
crumbs and seasoning, using half a cup of hot water to
mix them, or, if preferred, a beaten egg. Put this dressing
into the body of the fish, which is then to be fastened
together with a skewer. Cut the remainder of the pork
in narrow strips, and lay it in gashes cut across the back
of the fish about two inches apart. Dredge thickly with
flour, using about two tablespoonfuls. Put a tin baking-sheet
in the bottom of a pan, as without it the fish can not
be easily taken up. Lay the fish on this; pour a cup of
boiling water into the pan, and bake in a hot oven for one
hour, basting it very often that the skin may not crack;
and, at the end of half an hour, dredging again with flour,
repeating this every ten minutes till the fish is done. If
the water dries away, add enough to preserve the original
quantity. When the fish is done, slide it carefully from
<a name="Page_134" id="Page_134"></a>the tin sheet on to a hot platter. Set the baking-pan on
top of the stove. Mix a teaspoonful of flour with quarter
of a cup of cold water, and stir into the boiling gravy.
A tablespoonful of walnut or mushroom catchup, or of
Worcestershire sauce, may be added if liked. <i>Serve
very hot.</i></p>

<p>Before sending a baked fish to table, take out the
skewer. When done, it should have a handsome brown
crust. If pork is disliked, it may be omitted altogether,
and a tablespoonful of butter substituted in the stuffing.
Basting should be done as often as once in ten minutes,
else the skin will blister and crack. Where the fish is
large, it will be better to sew the body together after stuffing,
rather than to use a skewer. The string can be cut
and removed before serving.</p>

<p>If any is left, it can be warmed in the remains of the
gravy, or, if this has been used, make a gravy of one cup
of hot water, thickened with one teaspoonful of flour or
corn-starch stirred smooth first in a little cold water. Add
a tablespoonful of butter and any catchup or sauce desired.
Take all bones from the fish; break it up in small pieces,
and stew not over five minutes in the gravy. Or it can
be mixed with an equal amount of mashed potato or bread-crumbs,
a cup of milk and an egg added, with a teaspoonful
of salt and a saltspoonful of pepper, and baked until
brown&mdash;about fifteen minutes&mdash;in a hot oven.</p>


<p>TO BOIL FISH.</p>

<p>General directions have already been given. All fish
must boil <i>very</i> gently, or the outside will break before the
inside is done. In all cases salt and a little vinegar, a
teaspoonful each, are allowed to each quart of water.<a name="Page_135" id="Page_135"></a>
Where the fish has very little flavor, Dubois' receipt for
boiling will be found exceedingly nice, and much less
trouble than the name applied by professional cooks to
this method&mdash;<i>au court bouillon</i>&mdash;would indicate. It is
as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>Mince a carrot, an onion, and one stalk of celery, and
fry them in a little butter. Add two or three sprigs of
parsley, two tablespoonfuls of salt, six pepper-corns, and
three cloves. Pour on two quarts of boiling water and
one pint of vinegar, and boil for fifteen minutes. Skim as
it boils, and use, when cold, for boiling the fish. Wine
can be used instead of vinegar; and, by straining carefully
and keeping in a cold place, the same mixture can be used
several times.</p>


<p>TO BROIL FISH.</p>

<p>If the fish is large, it should be split, in order to insure
its being cooked through; though notches may be cut at
equal distances, so that the heat can penetrate. Small
fish may be broiled whole. The gridiron should be well
greased with dripping or olive oil. If a double-wire gridiron
is used, there will be no trouble in turning either
large or small fish. If a single-wire or old-fashioned iron
one, the best way is to first loosen with a knife any part
that sticks; then, holding a platter over the fish with one
hand, turn the gridiron with the other, and the fish can
then be returned to it without breaking.</p>

<p>Small fish require a hot, clear fire; large ones, a more
moderate one, that the outside may not be burned before
the inside is done. Cook always with the <i>skin-side</i> down
at first, and broil to a golden brown,&mdash;this requiring, for
small fish, ten minutes; for large ones, from ten to twenty,
according to size. When done, pepper and salt lightly;
<a name="Page_136" id="Page_136"></a>and to a two-pound fish allow a tablespoonful of butter
spread over it. Set the fish in the oven a moment, that
the butter may soak in, and then serve. A teaspoonful of
chopped parsley, and half a lemon squeezed over shad or
any fresh fish, is a very nice addition. Where butter,
lemon, and parsley are blended beforehand, it makes the
sauce known as <i>ma&icirc;tre d'h&ocirc;tel</i> sauce, which is especially
good for broiled shad.</p>

<p>In broiling steaks or cutlets of large fish,&mdash;say, salmon,
halibut, fresh cod, &amp;c.,&mdash;the same general directions
apply. Where very delicate broiling is desired, the pieces
of fish can be wrapped in buttered paper before laying
on the gridiron; this applying particularly to salmon.</p>


<p>TO FRY FISH.</p>

<p>Small fish&mdash;such as trout, perch, smelts, &amp;c.&mdash;may
simply be rolled in Indian meal or flour, and fried either
in the fat of salt pork, or in boiling lard or drippings. A
nicer method, however, with fish, whether small or in
slices, is to dip them first in flour or fine crumbs, then
in beaten egg,&mdash;one egg, with two tablespoonfuls of cold
water and half a teaspoonful of salt, being enough for
two dozen smelts; then rolling again in crumbs or meal,
and dropping into hot lard. The egg hardens instantly,
and not a drop of fat can penetrate the inside. Fry to a
golden brown. Take out with a skimmer; lay in the oven
on a double brown paper for a moment, and then serve.</p>

<p><i>Filets</i> of fish are merely flounders, or any flat fish with
few bones, boned, skinned, and cut in small pieces; then
egged and fried.</p>

<p>To bone a fish of this sort, use a very sharp knife.
The fish should have been scaled, but not cleaned or cut
<a name="Page_137" id="Page_137"></a>open. Make a cut down the back from head to tail.
Now, holding the knife pressed close to the bone, cut
carefully till the fish is free on one side; then turn, and cut
away the other. To skin, take half the fish at a time
firmly in one hand; hold the blade of the knife flat as in
boning, and run it slowly between skin and flesh. Cut
the fish in small diamond-shaped pieces; egg, crumb, and
put into shape with the knife; and then fry. The operation
is less troublesome than it sounds, and the result most
satisfactory.</p>

<p>The <i>bones and trimmings</i> remaining can either be
stewed in a pint of water till done, adding half a teaspoonful
of salt, a saltspoonful of pepper, and a tablespoonful
of catchup; straining the gravy off, and thickening
with one heaping teaspoonful of flour dissolved in a
little cold water: or they can be broiled. For broiled
bones, mix one saltspoonful of mustard, as much cayenne
as could be taken up on the point of a penknife, a saltspoonful
of salt, and a tablespoonful of vinegar. A
tablespoonful of olive-oil may be added, if liked. Lay
the bone in this, turning it till all is absorbed; broil over
a quick fire; and <i>serve very hot</i>.</p>

<p>Fish may also be fried in batter (p. 182), or these pieces,
or <i>filets</i>, may be laid on a buttered dish; a simple drawn
butter or cream sauce (p. 182) poured over them; the
whole covered with rolled bread or cracker-crumbs, dotted
with bits of butter, and baked half an hour. A cup of
canned mushrooms is often added.</p>


<p>TO STEW FISH.</p>

<p>Any fresh-water fish is good, cooked in this way; cat-fish
which have been soaked in salted water, to take away
<a name="Page_138" id="Page_138"></a>the muddy taste, being especially nice. Cut the fish in
small pieces. Boil two sliced onions in a cup of water.
Pour off this water; add another cup, and two tablespoonfuls
of wine, a saltspoonful of pepper, and salt to taste
(about half a teaspoonful). Put in the fish, and cook
for twenty minutes. Thicken the gravy with a heaping
teaspoonful of flour, rubbed to a cream with a teaspoonful
of butter. If wine is not used, add a sprig of chopped
parsley and the juice of half a lemon.</p>

<p>These methods will be found sufficient for all fresh fish,
no other special rules being necessary. Experience and
individual taste will guide their application. If the fish
is oily, as in the case of mackerel or herring, broiling
will always be better than frying. If fried, let it be with
very little fat, as their own oil will furnish part.</p>


<p>TO BOIL SALT CODFISH.</p>

<p>The large, white cod, which cuts into firm, solid slices,
should be used. If properly prepared, there is no need of
the strong smell, which makes it so offensive to many, and
which comes only in boiling. The fish is now to be had
boned, and put up in small boxes, and this is by far the
most desirable form. In either case, lay in tepid water
<i>skin-side up</i>, and soak all night. If the skin is down, the
salt, instead of soaking out, settles against it, and is retained.
Change the water in the morning, and soak two
or three hours longer; then, after scraping and cleaning
thoroughly, put in a kettle with tepid water enough to well
cover it, and set it where it will heat to the scalding-point,
but <i>not boil</i>. Keep it at this point, but never let it boil a
moment. Let it cook in this way an hour: two will do
no harm. Remove every particle of bone and dark skin
<a name="Page_139" id="Page_139"></a>before serving, sending it to table in delicate pieces, none
of which need be rejected. With egg sauce (p. 169),
mashed or mealy boiled potatoes, and sugar-beets, this
makes the New-England &quot;fish dinner&quot; a thing of terror
when poorly prepared, but both savory and delicate where
the above rule is closely followed.</p>

<p>Fish-balls, and all the various modes of using salted
cod, require this preparation beforehand.</p>


<p>SALT COD WITH CREAM.</p>

<p>Flake two pounds of cold boiled salt cod very fine.
Boil one pint of milk. Mix butter the size of a small
egg with two tablespoonfuls of flour, and stir into it.
Add a few sprigs of parsley or half an onion minced
very fine, a pinch of cayenne pepper, and half a teaspoonful
of salt. Butter a quart pudding-dish. Put in
alternate layers of dressing and fish till nearly full.
Cover the top with sifted bread or cracker crumbs, dot
with bits of butter, and brown in a quick oven about
twenty minutes. The fish may be mixed with an equal
part of mashed potato, and baked; and not only codfish,
but any boiled <i>fresh</i> fish, can be used, in which case
double the measure of salt given will be required.</p>


<p>SPICED FISH.</p>

<p>Any remains of cold fresh fish may be used. Take out
all bones or bits of skin. Lay in a deep dish, and barely
cover with hot vinegar in which a few cloves and allspice
have been boiled. It is ready for use as soon as cold.</p>


<p>POTTED FISH.</p>

<p>Fresh herring or mackerel or shad may be used. Skin
<a name="Page_140" id="Page_140"></a>the fish, and cut in small pieces, packing them in a small
stone jar. Just cover with vinegar. For six pounds of
fish allow one tablespoonful of salt, and a dozen each of
whole allspice, cloves, and pepper-corns. Tie a thick
paper over the top of the cover, and bake five hours.
The vinegar dissolves the bones perfectly, and the fish is
an excellent relish at supper.</p>


<p>FISH CHOWDER.</p>

<p>Three pounds of any sort of fresh fish may be taken;
but fresh cod is always best. Six large potatoes and two
onions, with half a pound of salt pork.</p>

<p>Cut the pork into dice, and fry to a light brown. Add
the onions, and brown them also. Pour the remaining fat
into a large saucepan, or butter it, as preferred. Put in
a layer of potatoes, a little onion and pork, and a layer of
the fish cut in small pieces, salting and peppering each
layer. A tablespoonful of salt and one teaspoonful of
pepper will be a mild seasoning. A pinch of cayenne may
be added, if liked. Barely cover with boiling water, and
boil for half an hour. In the meantime boil a pint of
milk, and, when at boiling-point, break into it three ship
biscuit or half a dozen large crackers; add a heaping
tablespoonful of butter. Put the chowder in a platter, and
pile the softened crackers on top, pouring the milk over
all. Or the milk may be poured directly into the chowder;
the crackers laid in, and softened in the steam; and the
whole served in a tureen. Three or four tomatoes are
sometimes added. In clam chowder the same rule would
be followed, substituting one hundred clams for the fish,
and using a small can of tomatoes if fresh ones were not
in season.<a name="Page_141" id="Page_141"></a></p>


<p>STEWED OYSTERS.</p>

<p>The rule already given for <i>oyster soup</i> is an excellent
one, omitting the thickening. A simpler one is to strain
the juice from a quart of oysters, and add an equal
amount of water. Bring it to boiling-point; skim carefully;
season with salt to taste, this depending on the
saltness of the oysters, half a teaspoonful being probably
enough. Add a saltspoonful of pepper, a tablespoonful
of butter, and a cup of milk. The milk may be omitted,
if preferred. Add the oysters. Boil till the edges curl,
and no longer. Serve at once, as they toughen by
standing.</p>


<p>FRIED OYSTERS.</p>

<p>Choose large oysters, and drain thoroughly in a colander.
Dry in a towel. Dip first in sifted cracker-crumbs;
then in egg, one egg beaten with a large spoonful of
cold water, half a teaspoonful of salt, and a saltspoonful
of pepper, being enough for two dozen oysters. Roll
again in crumbs, and drop into boiling lard. If a wire
frying-basket is used, lay them in this. Fry to a light
brown. Lay them on brown paper a moment to drain,
and serve at once on a <i>hot platter</i>. As they require
hardly more than a minute to cook, it is better to wait till
all are at the table before beginning to fry. Oysters are
very good, merely fried in a little hot butter; but the first
method preserves their flavor best.</p>


<p>SCALLOPED OYSTERS.</p>

<p>One quart of oysters; one large breakfast cup of
cracker or bread crumbs, the crackers being nicer if
freshly toasted and rolled hot; two large spoonfuls
of butter; one teaspoonful of salt; half a teaspoonful
<a name="Page_142" id="Page_142"></a>of pepper; one saltspoonful of mace. Mix the salt,
pepper, and mace together. Butter a pudding-dish; heat
the juice with the seasoning and butter, adding a teacup
of milk or cream if it can be had, though water will answer.
Put alternate layers of crumbs and oysters, filling
the dish in this way. Pour the juice over, and bake in a
quick oven twenty minutes. If not well browned, heat
a shovel red-hot, and brown the top with that; longer
baking toughening the oysters.</p>


<p>OYSTERS FOR PIE OR PATTIES.</p>

<p>One quart of oysters put on to boil in their own liquor.
Turn them while boiling into a colander to drain. Melt
a piece of butter the size of an egg in the saucepan, add
a tablespoonful of sifted flour, and stir one minute. Pour
in the oyster liquor slowly, which must be not less than a
large cupful. Beat the yolks of two eggs thoroughly
with a saltspoonful of salt, a pinch of cayenne pepper,
and one of mace. Add to the boiling liquor, but do not
let it boil. Put in the oysters, and either use them to
fill a pie, the form for which is already baked, for patties
for dinner, or serve them on thin slices of buttered toast
for breakfast or tea.</p>


<p>SPICED OR PICKLED OYSTERS.</p>

<p>To a gallon of large, fine oysters, allow one pint of
cider or white-wine vinegar; one tablespoonful of salt;
one grated nutmeg; eight blades of mace; three dozen
cloves, and as many whole allspice; and a saltspoon even
full of cayenne pepper. Strain the oyster juice, and
bring to the boiling-point in a porcelain-lined kettle.
Skim carefully as it boils up. Add the vinegar, and skim
<a name="Page_143" id="Page_143"></a>also, throwing in the spices and salt when it has boiled a
moment. Boil all together for five minutes, and then
pour over the oysters, adding a lemon cut in very thin
slices. They are ready for the table next day, but will
keep a fortnight or more in a cold place. If a sharp
pickle is desired, use a quart instead of a pint of vinegar.</p>


<p>SMOTHERED OYSTERS (<i>Maryland fashion</i>).</p>

<p>Drain all the juice from a quart of oysters. Melt in a
frying-pan a piece of butter the size of an egg, with as
much cayenne pepper as can be taken up on the point
of a penknife, and a saltspoonful of salt. Put in the
oysters, and cover closely. They are done as soon as the
edges ruffle. Serve on thin slices of buttered toast as a
breakfast or supper dish. A glass of sherry is often
added.</p>


<p>OYSTER OR CLAM FRITTERS.</p>

<p>Chop twenty-five clams or oysters fine, and mix them
with a batter made as follows: One pint of flour, in
which has been sifted one heaping teaspoonful of baking-powder
and half a teaspoonful of salt; one large cup
of milk, and two eggs well beaten. Stir eggs and milk
together; add the flour slowly; and, last, the clams or
oysters. Drop by spoonfuls into boiling lard. Fry to a
golden brown, and serve at once; or they may be fried
like pancakes in a little hot fat. Whole clams or oysters
may be used instead of chopped ones, and fried singly.</p>


<p>TO BOIL LOBSTERS OR CRABS.</p>

<p>Be sure that the lobster is alive, as, if dead, it will not
be fit to use. Have water boiling in a large kettle, and,
holding the lobster or crab by the back, drop it in head
<a name="Page_144" id="Page_144"></a>foremost; the reason for this being, that the animal dies
instantly when put in in this way. An hour is required
for a medium-sized lobster, the shell turning red when
done. When cold, the meat can be used either plain or
in salad, or cooked in various ways. A can-opener will
be found very convenient in opening a lobster.</p>


<p>STEWED OR CURRIED LOBSTER.</p>

<p>Cut the meat into small bits, and add the green fat,
and the coral which is found only in the hen-lobster.
Melt in a saucepan one tablespoonful of butter and a
heaping tablespoonful of flour. Stir smoothly together,
adding slowly one large cup of either stock or milk, a
saltspoonful of mace, a pinch of cayenne pepper, and half
a teaspoonful of salt. Put in the lobster, and cook for
ten minutes. For curry, simply add one teaspoonful of
curry-powder. This stewed lobster may also be put in
the shell of the back, which has been cleaned and washed,
bread or cracker crumbs sprinkled over it, and browned
in the oven; or it may be treated as a scallop, buttering a
dish, and putting in alternate layers of crumbs and lobster,
ending with crumbs. Crabs, though more troublesome
to extract from the shell, are almost equally good,
treated in any of the ways given.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<h2><a name="MEATS" id="MEATS" />MEATS.</h2>


<p>The qualities and characteristics of meats have already
been spoken of in Part I., and it is necessary here to give
only a few simple rules for marketing.</p>

<p><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145"></a>The best BEEF is of a clear red color, slightly marbled
with fat, and the fat itself of a clear white. Where the
beef is dark red or bluish, and the fat yellow, it is too old,
or too poorly fed, to be good. The sirloin and ribs,
especially the sixth, seventh, and eighth, make the best
roasting-pieces. The ribs can be removed and used for
stock, and the beef rolled or skewered firmly, making a
piece very easily carved, and almost as presentable the
second day as the first. For steaks sirloin is nearly as
good, and much more economical, than porter-house, which
gives only a small eatable portion, the remainder being
only fit for the stock-pot. If the beef be very young and
tender, steaks from the round may be used; but these are
usually best stewed. Other pieces and modes of cooking
are given under their respective heads.</p>

<p>MUTTON should be a light, clear red, and the fat very
white and firm. It is always improved by keeping, and
in cold weather can be hung for a month, if carefully
watched to see that it has not become tainted. Treated
in this way, well-fed mutton is equal to venison. If the
fat is deep yellow, and the lean dark red, the animal is
too old; and no keeping will make it really good eating.
Four years is considered the best age for prime mutton.</p>

<p>VEAL also must have clear white fat, and should be
fine in grain. If the kidney is covered with firm white
fat, it indicates health, and the meat is good; if yellow,
it is unwholesome, and should not be eaten. The loin
and fillet are used in roasting, and are the choice pieces,
the breast coming next, and the neck and ribs being good
for stewing and fricassees.</p>

<p>PORK should have fine, white fat, and the meat should
be white and smooth. Only country-fed pork should ever
<a name="Page_146" id="Page_146"></a>be eaten, the pig even then being liable to diseases unknown
to other animals, and the meat, even when carefully
fed, being at all times less digestible than any sort.
<i>Bacon</i>, carefully cured and smoked, is considered its most
wholesome form.</p>

<p>POULTRY come last. The best <i>Turkeys</i> have black legs;
and, if young, the toes and bill are soft and pliable. The
combs of fowls should be bright colored, and the legs
smooth.</p>

<p><i>Geese</i>, if young and fine, are plump in the breast, have
white soft fat, and yellow feet.</p>

<p><i>Ducks</i> are chosen by the same rule as geese, and are
firm and thick on the breast.</p>

<p><i>Pigeons</i> should be fresh, the breast plump, and the feet
elastic. Only experience can make one familiar with
other signs; and a good butcher can usually be trusted to
tide one over the season of inexperience, though the
sooner it ends the better for all parties concerned.</p>


<p>BOILED MEATS AND STEWS.</p>

<p>All meats intended to be boiled and served whole at
table must be put into <i>boiling water</i>, thus following an
entirely opposite rule from those intended for soups. In
the latter, the object being to extract all the juice, cold
water must always be used first, and then heated with the
meat in. In the former, all the juice is to be kept in;
and, by putting into boiling water, the albumen of the
meat hardens on the surface and makes a case or coating
for the meat, which accomplishes this end. Where something
between a soup and plain boiled meat is desired, as
in <i>beef bouilli</i>, the meat is put on in cold water, which is
brought to a boil <i>very quickly</i>, thus securing good gravy,
<a name="Page_147" id="Page_147"></a>yet not robbing the meat of all its juices. With corned
or salted meats, tongue, &amp;c., cold water must be used,
and half an hour to the pound allowed. If to be eaten
cold, such meats should always be allowed to cool in the
water in which they were boiled; and this water, if not
too salt, can be used for dried bean or pea soups.</p>


<p>BEEF &Agrave; LA MODE.</p>

<p>Six or eight pounds of beef from the round, cut thick.
Take out the bone, trim off all rough bits carefully, and
rub the meat well with the following spicing: One teaspoonful
each of pepper and ground clove, quarter of a
cup of brown sugar, and three teaspoonfuls of salt. Mix
these all together, and rub thoroughly into the beef, which
must stand over-night.</p>

<p>Next morning make a stuffing of one pint of bread or
cracker crumbs; one large onion chopped fine; a tablespoonful
of sweet marjoram or thyme; half a teaspoonful
each of pepper and ground clove, and a heaping teaspoonful
of salt. Add a large cup of hot water, in which has
been melted a heaping tablespoonful of butter, and stir
into the crumbs. Beat an egg light, and mix with it. If
there is more than needed to fill the hole, make gashes in
the meat, and stuff with the remainder. Now bind into
shape with a strip of cotton cloth, sewing or tying it
firmly. Put a trivet or small iron stand into a soup-pot,
and lay the beef upon it. Half cover it with cold water;
put in two onions stuck with three cloves each, a large
tablespoonful of salt, and a half teaspoonful of pepper;
and stew very slowly, allowing half an hour to the pound,
and turning the meat twice while cooking. At the end of
this time take off the cloth, and put the meat, which must
<a name="Page_148" id="Page_148"></a>remain on the trivet, in a roasting-pan. Dredge it quickly
with flour, set into a hot oven, and brown thoroughly.
Baste once with the gravy, and dredge again, the whole
operation requiring about half an hour. The water in the
pot should have been reduced to about a pint. Pour this
into the roasting-pan after the meat is taken up, skimming
off every particle of fat. Thicken with a heaping tablespoonful
of browned flour, stirred smooth in a little cold
water, and add a tablespoonful of catchup and two of
wine, if desired, though neither is necessary. Taste, as
a little more salt may be required.</p>

<p>The thick part of a leg of veal may be treated in the
same manner, both being good either hot or cold; and a
round of beef may be also used without spicing or stuffing,
and browned in the same way, the remains being either
warmed in the gravy or used for hashes or croquettes.</p>


<p>BEEF &Agrave; LA MODE (<i>Virginia fashion</i>).</p>

<p>Use the round, as in the foregoing receipt, and remove
the bone; and for eight pounds allow half a pint of good
vinegar; one large onion minced fine; half a teaspoonful
each of mustard, black pepper, clove, and allspice; and
two tablespoonfuls of brown sugar. Cut half a pound of
fat salt pork into lardoons, or strips, two or three inches
long and about half an inch square. Boil the vinegar
with the onion and seasoning, and pour over the strips of
pork, and let them stand till cold. Then pour off the
liquor, and thicken it with bread or cracker crumbs. Make
incisions in the beef at regular intervals,&mdash;a carving-steel
being very good for this purpose,&mdash;and push in the strips
of pork. Fill the hole from which the bone was taken
with the rest of the pork and the dressing, and tie the
<a name="Page_149" id="Page_149"></a>beef firmly into shape. Put two tablespoonfuls of dripping
or lard in a frying-pan, and brown the meat on all
sides. This will take about half an hour. Now put the
meat on a trivet in the kettle; half cover with boiling
water; and add a tablespoonful of salt, a teaspoonful of
pepper, an onion and a small carrot cut fine, and two or
three sprigs of parsley. Cook very slowly, allowing half
an hour to a pound, and make gravy by the directions
given for it in the preceding receipt.</p>

<p><i>Braised beef</i> is prepared by either method given here
for <i>&agrave; la mode</i> beef, but cooked in a covered iron pan, which
comes for the purpose, and which is good also for beef <i>&agrave;
la mode</i>, or for any tough meat which requires long cooking,
and is made tenderer by keeping in all the steam.</p>


<p>BOILED MUTTON.</p>

<p>A <i>shoulder</i>, or <i>fore-quarter</i>, of mutton, weighing five or
six pounds, will boil in an hour, as it is so thin. The <i>leg</i>,
or <i>hind-quarter</i>, requires twenty minutes to the pound;
though, if very young and tender, it will do in less. It
can be tried with a knitting-needle to see if it is tender.
It is made whiter and more delicate by boiling in a cloth,
but should be served without it. Boil in well-salted water
according to the rule already given. Boiled or mashed
turnips are usually served with it, and either drawn butter
or caper sauce as on p. 169.</p>

<p><i>Lamb</i> may be boiled in the same manner, but is better
roasted; and so also with <i>veal</i>.</p>


<p>BOILED CORNED BEEF.</p>

<p>If to be eaten hot, the <i>round</i> is the best piece. If cold
and pressed, what are called &quot;<i>plate pieces</i>&quot;&mdash;that is, the
<a name="Page_150" id="Page_150"></a>brisket, the flank, and the thin part of the ribs&mdash;may be
used. Wash, and put into cold water, allowing half an
hour to a pound after it begins to boil. If to be eaten
cold, let it stand in the water till nearly cold, as this
makes it richer. Take out all bones from a thin piece;
wrap in a cloth, and put upon a large platter. Lay a tin
sheet over it, and set on a heavy weight,&mdash;flat-irons will
do,&mdash;and let it stand over-night. Or the meat may be
picked apart with a knife and fork; the fat and lean
evenly mixed and packed into a pan, into which a smaller
pan is set on top of the meat, and the weight in this.
Thus marbled slices may be had. All corned beef is
improved by pressing, and all trimmings from it can be
used in hash or croquettes.</p>


<p>BOILED TONGUE.</p>

<p>Smoked tongue will be found much better than either
fresh or pickled tongues.</p>

<p>Soak it over night, after washing it. Put on in cold
water, and boil steadily four hours. Then take out; peel
off the skin, and return to the water to cool. Cut in <i>lengthwise</i>
slices, as this makes it tenderer. The root of the
tongue may be chopped very fine, and seasoned like deviled
ham (p. 265).</p>


<p>BOILED HAM.</p>

<p>Small hams are better in flavor and quality than large
ones. A brush should be kept to scrub them with, as it
is impossible to get them clean without it. Soak over-night
in plenty of cold water. Next morning, scrape,
and trim off all the hard black parts, scrubbing it well.
Put on to boil in cold water. Let it heat very gradually.<a name="Page_151" id="Page_151"></a>
Allow half an hour to the pound. When done, take from
the water, skin, and return, letting it remain till cold.
Dot with spots of black pepper, and cover the knuckle
with a frill of white paper. It is much nicer, whether
eaten hot or cold, if covered with bread or cracker crumbs
and browned in the oven. The fat is useless, save for
soap-grease. In carving, cut down in thin slices through
the middle. The knuckle can always be deviled (p.
265). A <i>leg of pork</i> which has simply been corned is
boiled in the same way as ham, soaking over-night, and
browning in the oven or not, as liked.</p>


<p>IRISH STEW.</p>

<p>This may be made of either beef or mutton, though
mutton is generally used. Reject all bones, and trim off
all fat and gristle, reserving these for the stock-pot. Cut
the meat in small pieces, not over an inch square, and
cover with cold water. Skim carefully as it boils up, and
see that the water is kept at the same level by adding as
it boils away. For two pounds of meat allow two sliced
onions, eight good-sized potatoes, two teaspoonfuls of
salt, and half a teaspoonful of pepper. Cover closely,
and cook for two hours. Thicken the gravy with one
tablespoonful of flour stirred smooth in a little cold water,
and serve very hot. The trimmings from a fore-quarter
of mutton will be enough for a stew, leaving a well-shaped
roast besides. If beef is used, add one medium-sized
carrot cut fine, and some sprigs of parsley. Such a stew
would be called by a French cook a <i>rago&ucirc;t</i>, and can be
made of any pieces of meat or poultry.<a name="Page_152" id="Page_152"></a></p>


<p>WHITE STEW, OR FRICASSEE.</p>

<p>Use <i>veal</i> for this stew, allowing an hour to a pound of
meat, and the same proportions of salt and pepper as in
the preceding receipt, adding a saltspoonful of mace.
Thicken, when done, with one heaping tablespoonful of
flour rubbed smooth with a piece of butter the size of an
egg, and one cup of hot milk added just at the last. A
cauliflower nicely boiled, cut up, and stewed with it a
moment, is very nice.</p>

<p>This stew becomes a <i>pot-pie</i> by making a nice biscuit-crust,
as on p. 164; cutting it out in rounds, and laying
in the kettle half an hour before the stew is done. Cover
closely, and do not turn them. Lay them, when done,
around the edge of the platter; pile the meat in the centre,
and pour over it the thickened gravy. Two beaten
eggs are sometimes added, and it is then called a <i>blanquette</i>
of veal.</p>


<p>BROWN STEW OR FRICASSEE.</p>

<p>To make these stews the meat is cut in small pieces,
and browned on each side in a little hot dripping; or, if
preferred, quarter of a pound of pork is cut in thin slices
and fried crisp, the fat from it being used for browning.
Cover the meat with warm water when done. If a stew,
any vegetables liked can be added; a fricassee never containing
them, having only meat and a gravy, thickened
with browned flour and seasoned in the proportions already
given. Part of a can of mushrooms may be used with a
beef stew, and a glass of wine added; this making a
<i>rago&ucirc;t with mushrooms</i>. The countless receipts one sees
in large cook-books for rago&ucirc;ts and fricassees are merely
variations in the flavoring of simple stews; and, after
<a name="Page_153" id="Page_153"></a>a little experimenting, any one can improvise her own,
remembering that the strongly-flavored vegetables (as
carrots) belong especially to dark meats, and the more
delicate ones to light. Fresh pork is sometimes used in
a white fricassee, in which case a little powdered sage is
better than mace as a seasoning.</p>

<p><i>Curries</i> can be made by adding a heaping teaspoonful
of curry-powder to a brown fricassee, and serving with
boiled rice; put the rice around the edge of the platter,
and pour the curry in the middle. Chicken makes the
best curry; but veal is very good. In a genuine East-Indian
curry, lemon-juice and grated cocoa-nut are added;
but it is an unwholesome combination.</p>


<p>BEEF ROLLS.</p>

<p>Two pounds of steak from the round, cut in very thin
slices. Trim off all fat and gristle, and cut into pieces
about four inches square. Now cut <i>very thin</i> as many
slices of salt pork as you have slices of steak, making
them a little smaller. Mix together one teaspoonful of
salt and one of thyme or summer savory, and one saltspoonful
of pepper. Lay the pork on a square of steak;
sprinkle with the seasoning; roll up tightly, and tie.
When all are tied, put the bits of fat and trimmings into
a hot frying-pan, and add a tablespoonful of drippings.
Lay in the rolls, and brown on all sides, which will require
about ten minutes; then put them in a saucepan.
Add to the fat in the pan a heaping tablespoonful of
flour, and stir till a bright brown. Pour in gradually one
quart of boiling water, and then strain it over the beef
rolls. Cover closely, and cook two hours, or less if the
steak is tender, stirring now and then to prevent scorch<a name="Page_154" id="Page_154"></a>ing.
Take off the strings before serving. These rolls
can be prepared without the pork, and are very nice; or
a whole beefsteak can be used, covering it with a dressing
made as for stuffed veal, and then rolling; tying at each
end, browning, and stewing in the same way. This can
be eaten cold or hot; while the small rolls are much better
hot. If wanted as a breakfast dish, they can be cooked
the day beforehand, left in the gravy, and simply heated
through next morning.</p>


<p>BRUNSWICK STEW.</p>

<p>Two squirrels or small chickens; one quart of sliced
tomatoes; one pint of sweet corn; one pint of lima or
butter beans; one quart of sliced potatoes; two onions;
half a pound of fat salt pork.</p>

<p>Cut the pork in slices, and fry brown; cut the squirrels
or chickens in pieces, and brown a little, adding the onion
cut fine. Now put all the materials in a soup-pot; cover
with two quarts of boiling water, and season with one
tablespoonful of salt, one of sugar, and half a teaspoonful
of cayenne pepper. Stew slowly for four hours.
Just before serving, cream a large spoonful of butter
with a heaping tablespoonful of flour; thin with the broth,
and pour in, letting all cook five minutes longer. To be
eaten in soup-plates.</p>


<p>ROASTED MEATS.</p>

<p>Our roasted meats are really <i>baked</i> meats; but ovens
are now so well made and ventilated, that there is little
difference of flavor in the two processes.</p>

<p>Allow ten minutes to the pound if the meat is liked
rare, and from twelve to fifteen, if well done. It is al<a name="Page_155" id="Page_155"></a>ways
better to place the meat on a trivet or stand made to
fit easily in the roasting-pan, so that it may not become
sodden in the water used for gravy. Put into a hot oven,
that the surface may soon sear over and hold in the juices,
enough of which will escape for the gravy. All rough
bits should have been trimmed off, and a joint of eight or
ten pounds rubbed with a tablespoonful of salt. Dredge
thickly with flour, and let it brown on the meat before
basting it, which must be done as often as once in fifteen
minutes. Pepper lightly. If the water in the pan dries
away, add enough to have a pint for gravy in the end.
Dredge with flour at least twice, as this makes a crisp and
relishable outer crust. Take up the meat, when done, on
a hot platter. Make the gravy in the roasting-pan, by
setting it on top of the stove, and first scraping up all the
browning from the corners and bottom. If there is much
fat, pour it carefully off. If the dredging has been well
managed while roasting, the gravy will be thick enough.
If not, stir a teaspoonful of browned flour smooth in cold
water, and add. Should the gravy be too light, color with
a teaspoonful of caramel, and taste to see that the seasoning
is right.</p>

<p><i>Mutton</i> requires fifteen minutes to the pound, unless
preferred rare, in which case ten will be sufficient. If a
tin kitchen is used, fifteen minutes for beef, and twenty
for mutton, will be needed.</p>


<p>STUFFED LEG OF MUTTON.</p>

<p>Have the butcher take out the first joint in a leg of
mutton; or it can be done at home by using a very sharp,
narrow-bladed knife, and holding it close to the bone.
Rub in a tablespoonful of salt, and then fill with a dress<a name="Page_156" id="Page_156"></a>ing
made as follows: One pint of fine bread or cracker
crumbs, in which have been mixed dry one even tablespoonful
of salt and one of summer savory or thyme, and
one teaspoonful of pepper. Chop one onion very fine,
and add to it, with one egg well beaten. Melt a piece of
butter the size of an egg in a cup of hot water, and pour
on the crumbs. If not enough to thoroughly moisten
them, add a little more. Either fasten with a skewer, or
sew up, and roast as in previous directions. Skim all the
fat from the gravy, as the flavor of mutton-fat is never
pleasant. A tablespoonful of currant jelly may be put
into the gravy-tureen, and the gravy strained upon it.
The meat must be basted, and dredged with flour, as
carefully as beef. Both the shoulder and saddle are
roasted in the same way, but without stuffing; and the
leg may be also, though used to more advantage with
one.</p>

<p>Lamb requires less time; a leg weighing six pounds
needing but one hour, or an hour and a quarter if roasted
before an open fire.</p>


<p>ROAST VEAL.</p>

<p>Veal is so dry a meat, that a moist dressing is almost
essential. This dressing may be made as in the previous
receipt; or, instead of butter, quarter of a pound of salt
pork can be chopped fine, and mixed with it. If the loin
is used,&mdash;and this is always best,&mdash;take out the bone to
the first joint, and fill the hole with dressing, as in the
leg of mutton. In using the breast, bone also, reserving
the bones for stock; lay the dressing on it; roll, and tie
securely. Baste often. Three or four thin slices of salt
pork may be laid on the top; or, if this is not liked, melt
<a name="Page_157" id="Page_157"></a>a tablespoonful of butter in a cup of hot water, and baste
with that. Treat it as in directions for roasted meats,
but allow a full half-hour to the pound, and make the
gravy as for beef. Cold veal makes so many nice dishes,
that a large piece can always be used satisfactorily.</p>


<p>ROAST PORK.</p>

<p>Bone the leg as in mutton, and stuff; substituting sage
for the sweet marjoram, and using two onions instead of
one. Allow half an hour to the pound, and make gravy
as for roast beef. Spare-ribs are considered most delicate;
and both are best eaten cold, the hot pork being
rather gross, and, whether hot or cold, less digestible
than any other meat.</p>


<p>ROAST VENISON.</p>

<p>In winter venison can be kept a month; and, in all
cases, it should hang in a cold place at least a month
before using. Allow half an hour to a pound in roasting,
and baste very often. Small squares of salt pork are
sometimes inserted in incisions made here and there, and
help to enrich the gravy. In roasting a haunch it is
usually covered with a thick paste of flour and water, and
a paper tied over this, not less than four hours being
required to roast it. At the end of three, remove the
paper and paste, dredge and baste till well browned. The
last basting is with a glass of claret; and this, and half a
small glass of currant jelly are added to the gravy. Venison
steaks are treated as in directions for broiled meats.</p>


<p>BAKED PORK AND BEANS.</p>

<p>Pick over one quart of dried beans, what is known as<a name="Page_158" id="Page_158"></a>
&quot;navy beans&quot; being the best, and soak over-night in
plenty of cold water.</p>

<p>Turn off the water in the morning, and put on to boil in
cold water till tender,&mdash;at least one hour. An earthen
pot is always best for this, as a shallow dish does not
allow enough water to keep them from drying. Drain off
the water. Put the beans in the pot. Take half a pound
of salt pork, fat and lean together being best. Score the
skin in small squares with a knife, and bury it, all but the
surface of this rind, in the beans. Cover them completely
with boiling water. Stir in one tablespoonful of salt,
and two of good molasses. Cover, and bake slowly,&mdash;not
less than five hours,&mdash;renewing the water if it bakes
away. Take off the cover an hour before they are done,
that the pork may brown a little. If pork is disliked, use
a large spoonful of butter instead. Cold baked beans can
be warmed in a frying-pan with a little water, and are
even better than at first, or they can be used in a soup as
in directions given. A teaspoonful of made mustard is
sometimes stirred in, and gives an excellent flavor to a
pot of baked beans. Double the quality if the family is
large, as they keep perfectly well in winter, the only season
at which so hearty a dish is required, save for laborers.</p>


<p>BROILED AND FRIED MEATS.</p>

<p>If the steak is tender, never pound or chop it. If
there is much fat, trim it off, or it will drop on the coals
and smoke. If tough, as in the country is very likely to
be the case, pounding becomes necessary, but a better
method is to use the chopping-knife; not chopping
through, but going lightly over the whole surface.
Broken as it may seem, it closes at once on the application
of a quick heat.</p>

<p><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159"></a>The best <i>broiler</i> is by all means a light wire one, which
can be held in the hand and turned quickly. The fire
should be quick and hot. Place the steak in the centre of
the broiler, and hold it close to the coals an instant on each
side, letting both sear over before broiling really begins.</p>

<p>Where a steak has been cut three-quarters of an inch
thick, ten minutes will be sufficient to cook it rare, and
fifteen will make it well done. Turn almost constantly,
and, when done, serve at once on a <i>hot dish</i>. Never salt
broiled meats beforehand, as it extracts the juices. Cut up
a tablespoonful of butter, and let it melt on the hot dish,
turning the steak in it once or twice. Salt and pepper
lightly, and, if necessary to have it stand at all, cover with
an earthen dish, or stand in the open oven. <i>Chops</i> and
<i>cutlets</i> are broiled in the same way. Veal is so dry a meat
that it is better fried.</p>

<p>Where broiling for any reason cannot be conveniently
done, the next best method is to heat a frying-pan very
hot; grease it with a bit of fat cut from the steak, just
enough to prevent it from sticking. Turn almost as constantly
as in broiling, and season in the same way when
done. Venison steaks are treated in the same manner.</p>


<p>VEAL CUTLETS.</p>

<p>Fry four or five slices of salt pork till brown, or use
drippings instead, if this fat is disliked. Let the cutlets,
which are best cut from the leg, be made as nearly of a
size as possible; dip them in well-beaten egg and then in
cracker-crumbs, and fry to a golden brown. Where the
veal is tough, it is better to parboil it for ten or fifteen
minutes before frying.<a name="Page_160" id="Page_160"></a></p>


<p>PORK STEAK.</p>

<p>Pork steaks or chops should be cut quite thin, and
sprinkled with pepper and salt and a little powdered sage.
Have the pan hot; put in a tablespoonful of dripping,
and fry the pork slowly for twenty minutes, turning often.
A gravy can be made for these, and for veal cutlets also,
by mixing a tablespoonful of flour with the fat left in the
pan, and stirring it till a bright brown, then adding a
large cup of boiling water, and salt to taste; a saltspoonful
being sufficient, with half the amount of pepper.</p>

<p>Pigs' liver, which many consider very nice, is treated in
precisely the same way, using a teaspoonful of powdered
sage to two pounds of liver.</p>


<p>FRIED HAM OR BACON.</p>

<p>Cut the ham in very thin slices. Take off the rind,
and, if the ham is old or hard, parboil it for five minutes.
Have the pan hot, and, unless the ham is quite fat, use a
teaspoonful of drippings. Turn the slices often, and
cook from five to eight minutes. They can be served
dry, or, if gravy is liked, add a tablespoonful of flour to
the fat, stir till smooth, and pour in slowly a large cup
of milk or water. Salt pork can be fried in the same
way. If eggs are to be fried with the ham, take up the
slices, break in the eggs, and dip the boiling fat over them
as they fry. If there is not fat enough, add half a cup
of lard. To make each egg round, put muffin-rings into
the frying-pan, and break an egg into each, pouring the
boiling fat over them from a spoon till done, which will
be in from three to five minutes. Serve one on each slice
of ham, and make no gravy. The fat can be strained,
and used in frying potatoes.<a name="Page_161" id="Page_161"></a></p>


<p>FRIED TRIPE.</p>

<p>The tripe can be merely cut in squares, rolled in flour,
salted and peppered, and fried brown in drippings, or the
pieces may be dipped in a batter made as for clam fritters,
or egged and crumbed like oysters, and fried. In cities
it can be bought already prepared. In the country it
must first be cleaned, and then boiled till tender.</p>


<p>TO WARM COLD MEATS.</p>

<p>Cold roast beef should be cut in slices, the gravy
brought to boiling-point, and each slice dipped in just
long enough to heat, as stewing in the gravy toughens it.
Rare mutton is treated in the same way, but is nicer
warmed in a chafing-dish at table, adding a tablespoonful
of currant jelly and one of wine to the gravy. Venison
is served in the same manner. Veal and pork can cook
in the gravy without toughening, and so with turkey and
chicken. Cold duck or game is very nice warmed in the
same way as mutton, the bones in all cases being reserved
for stock.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<h2><a name="POULTRY" id="POULTRY" />POULTRY.</h2>


<p>TO CLEAN POULTRY.</p>

<p>First be very careful to singe off all down by holding
over a blazing paper, or a little alcohol burning in a
saucer. Cut off the feet and ends of the wings, and the
neck as far as it is dark. If the fowl is killed at home,
be sure that the head is chopped off, and never allow
the neck to be wrung as is often done. It is not only
<a name="Page_162" id="Page_162"></a>an unmerciful way of killing, but the blood has thus no
escape, and settles about all the vital organs. The head
should be cut off, and the body hang and bleed thoroughly
before using.</p>

<p>Pick out all the pin-feathers with the blade of a small
knife. Turn back the skin of the neck, loosening it with
the finger and thumb, and draw out the windpipe and crop,
which can be done without making any cut. Now cut a
slit in the lower part of the fowl, the best place being
close to the thigh. By working the fingers in slowly,
keeping them close to the body, the whole intestines can
be removed in a mass. Be especially careful not to break
the gall-bag, which is near the upper part of the breastbone,
and attached to the liver. If this operation is carefully
performed, it will be by no means so disagreeable as
it seems. A French cook simply wipes out the inside,
considering that much flavor is lost by washing. I prefer
to wash in one water, and dry quickly, though in the case
of an old fowl, which often has a strong smell, it is better
to dissolve a teaspoonful of soda in the first water, which
should be warm, and wash again in cold, then wiping dry
as possible. Split and wash the gizzard, reserving it for
gravy.</p>


<p>DRESSING FOR POULTRY.</p>

<p>One pint of bread or cracker crumbs, into which mix
dry one teaspoonful of pepper, one of thyme or summer
savory, one even tablespoonful of salt, and, if in season,
a little chopped parsley. Melt a piece of butter the size
of an egg in one cup of boiling water, and mix with the
crumbs, adding one or two well-beaten eggs. A slice of
salt pork chopped fine is often substituted for the butter.</p>

<p><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163"></a>For <i>ducks</i> two onions are chopped fine, and added to
the above; or a potato dressing is made, as for geese,
using six large boiled potatoes, mashed hot, and seasoned
with an even tablespoonful of salt, a teaspoonful each of
sage and pepper, and two chopped onions.</p>

<p><i>Game</i> is usually roasted unstuffed; but grouse and
prairie-chickens may have the same dressing as chickens
and turkeys, this being used also for boiled fowls.</p>


<p>ROAST TURKEY.</p>

<p>Prepare by cleaning, as in general directions above, and,
when dry, rub the inside with a teaspoonful of salt. Put
the gizzard, heart, and liver on the fire in a small saucepan,
with one quart of boiling water and one teaspoonful of
salt, and boil two hours. Put a little stuffing in the breast,
and fold back the skin of the neck, holding it with a stitch
or with a small skewer. Put the remainder in the body,
and sew it up with darning-cotton. Cross and tie the legs
down tight, and run a skewer through the wings to fasten
them to the body. Lay it in the roasting-pan, and for
an eight-pound turkey allow not less than three hours'
time, a ten or twelve pound one needing four. Put a pint
of boiling water with one teaspoonful of salt in the pan,
and add to it as it dries away. Melt a heaping tablespoonful
of butter in the water, and baste very often.
The secret of a handsomely-browned turkey, lies in this
frequent basting. Dredge over the flour two or three times,
as in general roasting directions, and turn the turkey so
that all sides will be reached. When done, take up on a
hot platter. Put the baking-pan on the stove, having
before this chopped the gizzard and heart fine, and mashed
the liver, and put them in the gravy-tureen. Stir a table<a name="Page_164" id="Page_164"></a>spoonful
of brown flour into the gravy in the pan,
scraping up all the brown, and add slowly the water in
which the giblets were boiled, which should be about a
pint. Strain on to the chopped giblets, and taste to see
if salt enough. The gravy for all roast poultry is made
in this way. Serve with cranberry sauce or jelly.</p>


<p>ROAST OR BOILED CHICKENS.</p>

<p>Stuff and truss as with turkeys, and to a pair of chickens
weighing two and a half pounds each, allow one hour
to roast, basting often, and making a gravy as in preceding
receipt.</p>

<p>Boil as in rule for turkeys.</p>


<p>ROAST DUCK.</p>

<p>After cleaning, stuff as in rule given for poultry dressing,
and roast,&mdash;if game, half an hour; if tame, one
hour, making gravy as in directions given, and serving
with currant jelly.</p>


<p>ROAST GOOSE.</p>

<p>No fat save its own is needed in basting a goose,
which, if large, requires two hours to roast. Skim off as
much fat as possible before making the gravy, as it has
a strong taste.</p>


<p>BIRDS.</p>

<p>Small birds may simply be washed and wiped dry, tied
firmly, and roasted twenty minutes, dredging with flour,
basting with butter and water, and adding a little currant
jelly or wine to the gravy. They may be served on toast.<a name="Page_165" id="Page_165"></a></p>


<p>FRIED CHICKEN.</p>

<p>Cut the chicken into nice pieces for serving. Roll in
flour, or, if preferred, in beaten egg and crumbs. Heat
a cupful of nice dripping or lard; add a teaspoonful of
salt and a saltspoonful of pepper; lay in the pieces, and
fry brown on each side, allowing not less than twenty
minutes for the thickest pieces and ten for the thin ones.
Lay on a hot platter, and make a gravy by adding one
tablespoonful of flour to the fat, stirring smooth, and
adding slowly one cupful of boiling water or stock. Strain
over the chicken. Milk or cream is often used instead of
water.</p>


<p>BROWN FRICASSEE.</p>

<p>Fry one or two chickens as above, using only flour to
roll them in. Three or four slices of salt pork may be
used, cutting them in bits, and frying brown, before putting
in the chicken. When fried, lay the pieces in a
saucepan, and cover with warm water, adding one teaspoonful
of salt and a saltspoonful of pepper. Cover
closely, and stew one hour, or longer if the chickens are
old. Take up the pieces, and thicken the gravy with one
tablespoonful of flour, first stirred smooth in a little cold
water. Or the flour may be added to the fat in the pan
after frying, and water enough for a thin gravy, which
can all be poured into the saucepan, though with this
method there is more danger of burning. If not dark
enough, color with a teaspoonful of caramel. By adding
a chopped onion fried in the fat, and a teaspoonful of
curry-powder, this becomes a curry, to be served with
boiled rice.<a name="Page_166" id="Page_166"></a></p>


<p>WHITE FRICASSEE.</p>

<p>Cut up the chicken as in brown fricassee, and stew
without frying for an hour and a half, reducing the water
to about one pint. Take up the chicken on a hot platter.
Melt one tablespoonful of butter in a saucepan, and add
a heaping tablespoonful of flour, stirring constantly till
smooth. Pour in slowly one cup of milk, and, as it boils
and thickens, add the chicken broth, and serve. This
becomes a pot-pie by adding biscuit-crust as in rule for
veal pot-pie, p. 150, and serving in the same way.
The same crust may also be used with a brown fricassee,
but is most customary with a white.</p>


<p>CHICKEN PIE.</p>

<p>Make a fricassee, as above directed, either brown or
white, as best liked, and a nice pie-crust, as on p. 224,
or a biscuit-crust if pie-crust is considered too rich. Line
a deep baking-dish with the crust; a good way being to
use a plain biscuit-crust for the lining, and pie-crust for
the lid. Lay in the cooked chicken; fill up with the
gravy, and cover with pastry, cutting a round hole in the
centre; and bake about three-quarters of an hour. The
top can be decorated with leaves made from pastry, and
in this case will need to have a buttered paper laid over it
for the first twenty minutes, that they need not burn. Eat
either cold or hot. Game pies can be made in the same
way, and veal is a very good substitute for chicken.
Where veal is used, a small slice of ham may be added,
and a little less salt; both veal and ham being cut very
small before filling the pie.<a name="Page_167" id="Page_167"></a></p>


<p>BOILED TURKEY.</p>

<p>Clean, stuff, and truss the fowl selected, as for a
roasted turkey. The body is sometimes filled with oysters.
To truss in the tightest and most compact way, run
a skewer under the leg-joint between the leg and the thigh,
then through the body and under the opposite leg-joint in
the same way; push the thighs up firmly close to the
sides; wind a string about the ends of the skewer, and tie
it tight. Treat the wings in the same way, though in
boiled fowls the points are sometimes drawn under the
back, and tied there. The turkey may be boiled with or
without cloth around it. In either case use <i>boiling</i> water,
salted as for stock, and allow twenty minutes to the pound.
It is usually served with oyster sauce, but parsley or
capers may be used instead.</p>


<p>CHICKEN CROQUETTES.</p>

<p>Take all the meat from a cold roast or boiled chicken,
and chop moderately fine. Mince an onion very small,
and fry brown in a piece of butter the size of an egg.
Add one small cup of stock or water; one saltspoonful
each of pepper and mace; one teaspoonful of salt; the
juice of half a lemon; two well-beaten eggs; and, if
liked, a glass of wine. Make into small rolls like corks,
or mold in a pear shape, sticking in a clove for the stem
when fried. Roll in sifted cracker-crumbs; dip in an
egg beaten with a spoonful of water, and again in
crumbs; put in the frying-basket, and fry in boiling lard.
Drain on brown paper, and pile on a napkin in serving.</p>

<p>A more delicate croquette is made by using simply the
white meat, and adding a set of calf's brains which have
been boiled in salted water. A cupful of boiled rice
<a name="Page_168" id="Page_168"></a>mashed fine is sometimes substituted for the brains. Use
same seasoning as above, adding quarter of a saltspoonful
of cayenne, omitting the wine, and using instead half a
cup of cream or milk. Fry as directed. Veal croquettes
can hardly be distinguished from those of chicken.</p>


<p>PHILADELPHIA CHICKEN CROQUETTES.</p>

<p>The croquette first given is dry when fried, and even
the second form is somewhat so, many preferring them so.
For the creamy delicious veal, sweetbread, or chicken
croquette one finds in Philadelphia, the following materials
are necessary: one pint of hot cream; two even
tablespoonfuls of butter; four heaping tablespoonfuls of
sifted flour; half a teaspoonful of salt; half a saltspoonful
of white pepper; a dust of cayenne; half a teaspoonful
of celery salt; and one teaspoonful of onion juice. Scald
the cream in a double boiler. Melt the butter in an
enameled or granite saucepan, and as it boils, stir in the
flour, stirring till perfectly smooth. Add the cream very
slowly, stirring constantly as it thickens, adding the
seasoning at the last. An egg may also be added, but the
croquettes are more creamy without it. To half a pound
of chicken chopped fine, add one teaspoonful of lemon
juice and one of minced parsley, one beaten egg and the
pint of cream sauce. Spread on a platter to cool, and
when cool make into shapes, either corks or like pears;
dip in egg and crumbs, and fry in boiling fat. Oyster,
sweetbread, and veal croquettes are made by the same
form, using a pint of chopped oysters. To the sweetbreads
a small can of mushrooms may be added cut in
bits.<a name="Page_169" id="Page_169"></a></p>


<p>SALMI OF DUCKS OR GAME.</p>

<p>Cut the meat from cold roast ducks or game into small
bits. Break the bones and trimmings, and cover with
stock or cold water, adding two cloves, two pepper-corns,
and a bay-leaf or pinch of sweet herbs. Boil till reduced
to a cupful for a pint of meat. Mince two small onions
fine, and fry brown in two tablespoonfuls of butter; then
add two tablespoonfuls of flour and stir till deep brown,
adding to it the strained broth from the bones. Put in
the bits of meat with one tablespoonful of lemon juice and
one of Worcestershire sauce. Simmer for fifteen minutes,
and at the last add, if liked, six or eight mushrooms and a
glass of claret. Serve on slices of fried bread, and garnish
with fried bread and parsley.</p>


<p>CASSEROLE OF RICE AND MEAT.</p>

<p>This can be made of any kind of meat, but is nicest of
veal or poultry. Boil a large cup of rice till tender, and
let it cool. Chop fine half a pound of meat, and season
with half a teaspoonful of salt, a small grated onion, and
a teaspoonful of minced parsley and a pinch of cayenne.
Add a teacupful of cracker crumbs and a beaten egg, and
wet with stock or hot water enough to make it pack easily.
Butter a tin mould, quart size best, and line the bottom
and sides with rice about half an inch thick. Pack in the
meat; cover with rice, and steam one hour. Loosen at
edges; turn out on hot platter, and pour tomato sauce
around it.</p>


<p>ITALIA'S PRIDE.</p>

<p>This is a favorite dish in the writer's family, having
been sent many years ago from Italy by a friend who had
<a name="Page_170" id="Page_170"></a>learned its composition from her Italian cook. Its name
was bestowed by the children of the house. One large cup
of chopped meat; two onions minced and fried brown in
butter; a pint of cold boiled macaroni or spaghetti; a
pint of fresh or cold stewed tomatoes; one teaspoonful of
salt; half a teaspoonful of white pepper. Butter a pudding
dish, and put first a layer of macaroni, then tomato, then
meat and some onion and seasoning, continuing this till
the dish is full. Cover with fine bread crumbs, dot with
bits of butter, and bake for half an hour. Serve very
hot.</p>


<p>DEVILED HAM.</p>

<p>For this purpose use either the knuckle or any odds
and ends remaining. Cut off all dark or hard bits, and
see that at least a quarter of the amount is fat. Chop as
finely as possible, reducing it almost to a paste. For a
pint-bowl of this, make a dressing as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>One even tablespoonful of sugar; one even teaspoonful
of ground mustard; one saltspoonful of cayenne pepper;
one spoonful of butter; one teacupful of boiling vinegar.
Mix the sugar, mustard, and pepper thoroughly, and add
the vinegar little by little. Stir it into the chopped ham,
and pack it in small molds, if it is to be served as a lunch
or supper relish, turning out upon a small platter and garnishing
with parsley.</p>

<p>For sandwiches, cut the bread very thin; butter lightly,
and spread with about a teaspoonful of the deviled ham.
The root of a boiled tongue can be prepared in the same
way. If it is to be kept some time, pack in little jars,
and pour melted butter over the top.<a name="Page_171" id="Page_171"></a></p>


<p>BONED TURKEY.</p>

<p>This is a delicate dish, and is usually regarded as an
impossibility for any ordinary housekeeper; and unless
one is getting up a supper or other entertainment, it is
hardly worth while to undertake it. If the legs and wings
are left on, the boning becomes much more difficult. The
best plan is to cut off both them and the neck, boiling all
with the turkey, and using the meat for croquettes or
hash.</p>

<p>Draw only the crop and windpipe, as the turkey is more
easily handled before dressing. Choose a fat hen turkey
of some six or seven pounds weight, and cut off legs up to
second joint, with half the wings and the neck. Now,
with a very sharp knife, make a clean cut down the entire
back, and holding the knife close to the body, cut away
the flesh, first on one side and then another, making a
clean cut around the pope's nose. Be very careful, in cutting
down the breastbone, not to break through the skin.
The entire meat will now be free from the bones, save the
pieces remaining in legs and wings. Cut out these, and
remove all sinews. Spread the turkey skin-side down on
the board. Cut out the breasts, and cut them up in long,
narrow pieces, or as you like. Chop fine a pound and a
half of veal or fresh pork, and a slice of fat ham also.
Season with one teaspoonful of salt, a saltspoonful each
of mace and pepper, half a saltspoonful of cayenne, and
the juice of lemon. Cut half a pound of cold boiled
smoked tongue into dice. Make layers of this force-meat,
putting half of it on the turkey and then the dice of
tongue, with strips of the breast between, using force meat
for the last layer. Roll up the turkey in a tight roll, and
<a name="Page_172" id="Page_172"></a>sew the skin together. Now roll it firmly in a napkin,
tying at the ends and across in two places to preserve the
shape. Cover it with boiling water, salted as for stock,
putting in all the bones and giblets, and two onions stuck
with three cloves each. Boil four hours. Let it cool in
the liquor. Take up in a pan, lay a tin sheet on it, and
press with a heavy weight. Strain the water in which it
was boiled, and put in a cold place.</p>

<p>Next day take off the napkin, and set the turkey in the
oven a moment to melt off any fat. It can be sliced and
eaten in this way, but makes a handsomer dish served as
follows:</p>

<p>Remove the fat from the stock, and heat three pints of
it to boiling-point, adding two-thirds of a package of
gelatine which has been soaked in a little cold water.
Strain a cupful of this into some pretty mold,&mdash;an ear
of corn is a good shape,&mdash;and the remainder in two
pans or deep plates, coloring each with caramel,&mdash;a teaspoonful
in one, and two in the other. Lay the turkey on
a small platter turned face down in a larger one, and when
the jelly is cold and firm, put the molded form on top of
it. Now cut part of the jelly into rounds with a pepper-box
top or a small star-cutter, and arrange around the
mold, chopping the rest and piling about the edge, so
that the inner platter or stand is completely concealed.
The outer row of jelly can have been colored red by cutting
up, and boiling in the stock for it, half of a red beet.
Sprigs of parsley or delicate celery-tops may be used as
garnish, and it is a very elegant-looking as well as savory
dish. The legs and wings can be left on and trussed outside,
if liked, making it as much as possible in the original
shape; but it is no better, and much more trouble.<a name="Page_173" id="Page_173"></a></p>


<p>JELLIED CHICKEN.</p>

<p>Tenderness is no object here, the most ancient dweller
in the barnyard answering equally well, and even better
than &quot;broilers.&quot;</p>

<p>Draw carefully, and if the fowl is old, wash it in water
in which a spoonful of soda has been dissolved, rinsing in
cold. Put on in cold water, and season with a tablespoonful
of salt and a half teaspoonful of pepper. Boil
till the meat slips easily from the bones, reducing the
broth to about a quart. Strain, and when cold, take off
the fat. Where any floating particles remain, they can
always be removed by laying a piece of soft paper on the
broth for a moment. Cut the breast in long strips, and
the rest of the meat in small pieces. Boil two or three
eggs hard, and when cold, cut in thin slices. Slice a
lemon very thin. Dissolve half a package of gelatine in
a little cold water; heat the broth to boiling-point, and
add a saltspoonful of mace, and if liked, a glass of
sherry, though it is not necessary, pouring it on the
gelatine. Choose a pretty mold, and lay in strips of the
breast; then a layer of egg-slices, putting them close
against the mold. Nearly fill with chicken, laid in lightly;
then strain on the broth till it is nearly full, and set in a
cold place. Dip for an instant in hot water before turning
out. It is nice as a supper or lunch dish, and very
pretty in effect.</p>

<h2><a name="SAUCES_AND_SALADS" id="SAUCES_AND_SALADS" />SAUCES AND SALADS.</h2>


<p>The foundation for a large proportion of sauces is in
what the French cook knows as a <i>roux</i>, and we as &quot;drawn
butter.&quot; As our drawn butter is often lumpy, or with
<a name="Page_174" id="Page_174"></a>the taste of the raw flour, I give the French method as a
security against such disaster.</p>


<p>TO MAKE A ROUX.</p>

<p>Melt in a saucepan a piece of butter the size of an egg,
and add two even tablespoonfuls of sifted flour; one
ounce of butter to two of flour being a safe rule. Stir
till smooth, and pour in slowly one pint of milk, or milk
and water, or water alone. With milk it is called <i>cream
roux</i>, and is used for boiled fish and poultry. Where
the butter and flour are allowed to brown, it is called a
<i>brown roux</i>, and is thinned with the soup or stew which
it is designed to thicken. Capers added to a <i>white
roux</i>&mdash;which is the butter and flour, with water added&mdash;give
<i>caper sauce</i>, for use with boiled mutton. Pickled
nasturtiums are a good substitute for capers. Two hard-boiled
eggs cut fine give egg sauce. Chopped parsley or
pickle, and the variety of catchups and sauces, make an
endless variety; the <i>white roux</i> being the basis for all of
them.</p>


<p>BREAD SAUCE.</p>

<p>For this sauce boil one point of milk, with one onion
cut in pieces. When it has boiled five minutes, take out
the onion, and thicken the milk with half a pint of sifted
bread-crumbs. Melt a teaspoonful of butter in a frying-pan;
put in half a pint of coarser crumbs, stirring them
till a light brown. Flavor the sauce with half a teaspoonful
of salt, a saltspoonful of pepper, and a grate of nutmeg;
and serve with game, helping a spoonful of the
sauce, and one of the browned crumbs. The boiled onion
may be minced fine and added, and the browned crumbs
omitted.<a name="Page_175" id="Page_175"></a></p>


<p>CELERY SAUCE.</p>

<p>Wash and boil a small head of celery, which has been
cut up fine, in one pint of water, with half a teaspoonful
of salt. Boil till tender, which will require about half an
hour. Make a <i>cream roux</i>, using half a pint of milk,
and adding quarter of a saltspoonful of white pepper. Stir
into the celery; boil a moment, and serve. A teaspoonful
of celery salt can be used, if celery is out of season,
adding it to the full rule for <i>cream roux</i>. Cauliflower may
be used in the same way as celery, cutting it very fine,
and adding a large cupful to the sauce. Use either with
boiled meats.</p>


<p>MINT SAUCE.</p>

<p>Look over and strip off the leaves, and cut them as
fine as possible with a sharp knife. Use none of the
stalk but the tender tips. To a cupful of chopped mint
allow an equal quantity of sugar, and half a cup of good
vinegar. It should stand an hour before using.</p>


<p>CRANBERRY SAUCE.</p>

<p>Wash one quart of cranberries in warm water, and pick
them over carefully. Put them in a porcelain-lined kettle,
with one pint of cold water and one pint of sugar, and
cook without stirring for half an hour, turning then into
molds. This is the simplest method. They can be
strained through a sieve, and put in bowls, forming a
marmalade, which can be cut in slices when cold; or the
berries can be crushed with a spoon while boiling, but
left unstrained.<a name="Page_176" id="Page_176"></a></p>


<p>APPLE SAUCE.</p>

<p>Pare, core, and quarter some apples (sour being best),
and stew till tender in just enough water to cover them.
Rub them through a sieve, allowing a teacupful of sugar to
a quart of strained apple, or even less, where intended to
eat with roast pork or goose. Where intended for lunch or
tea, do not strain, but treat as follows: Make a sirup of one
large cupful of sugar and one of water for every dozen good-sized
apples. Add half a lemon, cut in very thin slices.
Put in the apple; cover closely, and stew till tender, keeping
the quarters as whole as possible. The lemon may be
omitted.</p>


<p>PLAIN PUDDING SAUCE.</p>

<p>Make a <i>white roux</i>, with a pint of either water or milk;
but water will be very good. Add to it a large cup of
sugar, a teaspoonful of lemon or any essence liked, and
a wine-glass of wine. Vinegar can be substituted. Grate
in a little nutmeg, and serve hot.</p>


<p>MOLASSES SAUCE.</p>

<p>This sauce is intended especially for apple dumplings
and puddings. One pint of molasses; one tablespoonful
of butter; the juice of one lemon, or a large spoonful
of vinegar. Boil twenty minutes. It may be thickened
with a tablespoonful of corn-starch dissolved in a little
cold water, but is good in either case.</p>


<p>FOAMING SAUCE.</p>

<p>Cream half a cup of butter till very light, and add a
heaping cup of sugar, beating both till white. Set the
bowl in which it was beaten into a pan of boiling water,
<a name="Page_177" id="Page_177"></a>and allow it to melt slowly. Just before serving but <i>not
before</i>, pour into it slowly half a cup or four spoonfuls of
boiling water, stirring to a thick foam. Grate in nutmeg,
or use a teaspoonful of lemon essence, and if wine is
liked, add a glass of sherry or a tablespoonful of brandy.
For a pudding having a decided flavor of its own, a sauce
without wine is preferable.</p>


<p>HARD SAUCE</p>

<p>Beat together the same proportions of butter and sugar
as in the preceding receipt; add a tablespoonful of wine
if desired; pile lightly on a pretty dish; grate nutmeg
over the top, and set in a cold place till used.</p>


<p>FRUIT SAUCES.</p>

<p>The sirup of any nice canned fruit may be used cold
as sauce for cold puddings and blancmanges, or heated
and thickened for hot, allowing to a pint of juice a heaping
teaspoonful of corn-starch dissolved in a little cold
water, and boiling it five minutes. Strawberry or raspberry
sirup is especially nice.</p>


<p>PLAIN SALAD DRESSING.</p>

<p>Three tablespoonfuls of best olive-oil; one tablespoonful
of vinegar; one saltspoonful each of salt and pepper
mixed together; and then, with three tablespoonfuls of
best olive-oil, adding last the tablespoonful of vinegar.
This is the simplest form of dressing. The lettuce, or
other salad material, must be fresh and crisp, and should
not be mixed till the moment of eating.<a name="Page_178" id="Page_178"></a></p>


<p>SPANISH TOMATO SAUCE.</p>

<p>One can of tomatoes or six large fresh ones; two
minced onions fried brown in a large tablespoonful of
butter. Add to the tomatoes with three sprigs of parsley
and thyme, one teaspoonful of salt, and half a one of
pepper; three cloves and two allspice, with a small blade
of mace and a bit of lemon peel, and two lumps of sugar.
Stew very slowly for two hours, then rub through a sieve,
and return to the fire. Add two tablespoonfuls of flour,
browned with a tablespoonful of butter, and boil up once.
It should be smooth and thick. Keep on ice, and it will
keep a week. Excellent.</p>


<p>MAYONNAISE SAUCE.</p>

<p>For this sauce use the yolks of three raw eggs; one
even tablespoonful of mustard; one of sugar; one teaspoonful
of salt; and a saltspoonful of cayenne.</p>

<p>Break the egg yolks into a bowl; beat a few strokes,
and gradually add the mustard, sugar, salt, and pepper.
Now take a pint bottle of best olive-oil, and stir in a few
drops at a time. The sauce will thicken like a firm jelly.
When the oil is half in, add the juice of one lemon by
degrees with the remainder of the oil; and last, add
quarter of a cup of good vinegar. This will keep for
weeks, and can be used with either chicken, salmon, or
vegetable salad.</p>

<p>A simpler form can be made with the yolk of one egg,
half a pint of oil, and half the ingredients given above.
It can be colored red with the juice of a boiled beet, or
with the coral of a lobster, and is very nice as a dressing
for raw tomatoes, cutting them in thick slices, and putting
a little of it on each slice.</p>

<p><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179"></a>Mayonnaise may be varied in many ways, <i>sauce tartare</i>
being a favorite one. This is simply two even tablespoonfuls
of capers, half a small onion, and a tablespoonful
of parsley, and two gherkins or a small cucumber, all
minced fine and added to half a pint of mayonnaise.
This keeps a long time, and is very nice for fried fish or
plain boiled tongue.</p>


<p>DRESSING WITHOUT OIL.</p>

<p>Cream a small cup of butter, and stir into it the yolks
of three eggs. Mix together one teaspoonful of mustard,
one teaspoonful of salt, and quarter of a saltspoonful of
cayenne, and add to the butter and egg. Stir in slowly,
instead of oil, one cup of cream, and add the juice of one
lemon and half a cup of vinegar.</p>


<p>BOILED DRESSING FOR COLD SLAW.</p>

<p>This is good also for vegetable salads. One small cup
of good vinegar; two tablespoonfuls of sugar; half a
teaspoonful each of salt and mustard; a saltspoonful of
pepper; a piece of butter the size of a walnut; and two
beaten eggs. Put these all in a small saucepan over the
fire, and stir till it becomes a smooth paste. Have a firm,
white cabbage, very cold, and chopped fine; and mix the
dressing well through it. It will keep several days in a
cold place.</p>


<p>CHICKEN SALAD.</p>

<p>Boil a tender chicken, and when cold, cut all the meat
in dice. Cut up white tender celery enough to make the
same amount, and mix with the meat. Stir into it a tablespoonful
of oil with three of vinegar, and a saltspoonful
each of mustard and salt, and let it stand an hour or two.<a name="Page_180" id="Page_180"></a>
When ready to serve, mix the whole with a mayonnaise
sauce, leaving part to mask the top; or use the mayonnaise
alone, without the first dressing of vinegar and oil.
Lettuce can be substituted for celery; and where neither
is obtainable, a crisp white cabbage may be chopped fine,
and the meat of the chicken also, and either a teaspoonful
of extract of celery or celery-seed used to flavor it The
fat of the chicken, taken from the water in which it was
boiled, carefully melted and strained, and cooled again,
is often used by Southern housekeepers.</p>


<p>SALMON MAYONNAISE.</p>

<p>Carefully remove all the skin and bones from a pound
of boiled salmon, or use a small can of the sealed, draining
away all the liquid. Cut in small pieces, and season
with two tablespoonfuls of vinegar, half a small onion
minced fine, and half a teaspoonful each of salt and
pepper. Cover the bottom of the salad dish with crisp
lettuce-leaves; lay the salmon on it, and pour on the sauce.
The meat of a lobster can be treated in the same way.</p>

<h2><a name="EGGS_CHEESE_AND_BREAKFAST_DISHES" id="EGGS_CHEESE_AND_BREAKFAST_DISHES" />EGGS, CHEESE, AND BREAKFAST
DISHES.</h2>


<p>BOILED EGGS.</p>

<p>Let the water be boiling fast when the eggs are put in,
that it may not be checked. They should have lain in
warm water a few minutes before boiling, to prevent the
shells cracking. Allow three minutes for a soft-boiled
egg; four, to have the white firmly set; and ten, for a
<a name="Page_181" id="Page_181"></a>hard-boiled egg. Another method is to pour boiling water
on the eggs, and let them stand for ten minutes where
they will be nearly at boiling-point, though not boiling.
The white and yolk are then perfectly cooked, and of jelly-like
consistency.</p>


<p>POACHED EGGS.</p>

<p>Have a deep frying-pan full of boiling water,&mdash;simmering,
not boiling furiously. Put in two teaspoonfuls of
vinegar and a teaspoonful of salt. Break each egg into
a cup or saucer, allowing one for each person; slide gently
into the water, and let them stand five minutes, but without
boiling. Have ready small slices of buttered toast
which have been previously dipped quickly into hot water.
Take up the eggs on a skimmer; trim the edges evenly,
and slip off upon the toast, serving at once. For fried
eggs, see <i>Ham and Eggs</i>, p. 158.</p>


<p>SCRAMBLED EGGS.</p>

<p>Break half a dozen eggs into a bowl, and beat for a
minute. Have the frying-pan hot. Melt a tablespoonful
of butter, with an even teaspoonful of salt and a
saltspoonful of pepper, and turn in the eggs. Stir them
constantly as they harden, until they are a firm yet delicate
mixture of white and yellow, and turn into a hot
dish, serving at once. A cup of milk may be added if
liked. The whole operation should not exceed five
minutes.</p>


<p>BAKED EGGS.</p>

<p>Break the eggs into a buttered pudding-dish. Salt and
pepper them very lightly, and bake in a quick oven till
set. Or turn over them a cupful of good gravy, that of
<a name="Page_182" id="Page_182"></a>veal or poultry being especially nice, and bake in the
same way. Serve in the dish they were baked in.</p>


<p>STUFFED EGGS.</p>

<p>Boil eggs for twenty minutes. Drop them in cold water,
and when cold, take off the shells, and cut the egg in two
lengthwise. Take out the yolks carefully; rub them fine
on a plate, and add an equal amount of deviled ham, or of
cold tongue or chicken, minced very fine. If chicken is
used, add a saltspoonful of salt and a pinch of cayenne.
Roll the mixture into little balls the size of the yolk;
fill each white with it; arrange on a dish with sprigs of
parsley, and use cold as a lunch dish. They can also be
served hot by laying them in a deep buttered pie-plate,
covering with a cream <i>roux</i>, dusting thickly with bread-crumbs,
and browning in a quick oven.</p>


<p>PLAIN OMELET.</p>

<p>The pan for frying an omelet should be clean and
very smooth. Break the eggs one by one into a cup,
to avoid the risk of a spoiled one. Allow from three
to five, but never <i>over</i> five, for a single omelet. Turn
them into a bowl, and give them twelve beats with whisk
or fork. Put butter the size of an egg into the frying-pan,
and let it run over the entire surface. As it begins
to boil, turn in the eggs. Hold the handle of the pan
in one hand, and with the other draw the egg constantly
up from the edges as it sets, passing a knife underneath
to let the butter run under. Shake the pan now and then
to keep the omelet from scorching. It should be firm at
the edges, and creamy in the middle. When done, either
<a name="Page_183" id="Page_183"></a>fold over one-half on the other, and turn on to a hot platter
to serve at once, or set in the oven a minute to brown
the top, turning it out in a round. A little chopped ham
or parsley may be added. The myriad forms of omelet to
be found in large cook-books are simply this plain one,
with a spoonful or so of chopped mushrooms or tomatoes
or green pease laid in the middle of it just before folding
and serving. A variation is also made by beating whites
and yolks separately, then adding half a cup of cream or
milk; doubling the seasoning given above, and then following
the directions for frying. Quarter of an onion and a
sprig or two of parsley minced fine are a very nice addition.
A cupful of finely minced fish, either fresh or salt,
makes a fish omlet. Chopped oysters may also be used;
and many persons like a large spoonful of grated cheese,
though this is a French rather than American taste.</p>


<p>BAKED OMELET.</p>

<p>One large cup of milk; five eggs; a saltspoonful of
salt; and half a one of white pepper mixed with the last.
Beat the eggs well, a Dover egg-beater being the best
possible one where yolks and whites are not separated;
add the salt and pepper, and then the milk. Melt a piece
of butter the size of an egg in a frying-pan, and when it
boils, pour in the egg. Let it stand two minutes, or long
enough to harden a little, but do not stir at all. When a
little firm, put into a quick oven, and bake till brown. It
will rise very high, but falls almost immediately. Serve
at once on a very hot platter. This omelet can also be
varied with chopped ham or parsley. The old-fashioned
iron spider with short handle is best for baking it, as a
<a name="Page_184" id="Page_184"></a>long-handled pan cannot be shut up in the oven. This
omelet can also be fried in large spoonfuls, like pancakes,
rolling each one as done.</p>


<p>CHEESE FONDU.</p>

<p>This preparation of grated cheese and eggs can be made
in a large dish for several people, or in &quot;portions&quot; for
one, each in a small earthen dish. For one portion allow
two eggs; half a saltspoonful of salt; a heaping tablespoonful
of grated cheese; two of milk; and a few grains
of cayenne. Melt a teaspoonful of butter in the dish,
and when it boils, pour in the cheese and egg, and cook
slowly till it is well set. It is served in the dish in which
it is cooked, and should be eaten at once.</p>

<p>An adaptation of this has been made by Mattieu
Williams, the author of the &quot;Chemistry of Cookery.&quot;
It is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>Soak enough slices of bread to fill a quart pudding-dish,
in a pint of milk, to which half a teaspoonful of salt and
two beaten eggs have been added. Butter the pudding-dish
and lay in the bread, putting a thick coating of
grated cheese on each slice. Pour what milk may remain
over the top, and bake slowly about half an hour.</p>


<p>CHEESE SOUFFL&Eacute;.</p>

<p>Melt in a saucepan two tablespoonfuls of butter, and
add to it half a teaspoonful of dry mustard; a grain of
cayenne; a saltspoonful of white pepper; a grate of nutmeg;
two tablespoonfuls of flour; and stir all smooth,
adding a gill of milk and a large cupful of grated cheese.
Stir into this as much powdered bi-carbonate of potash as
<a name="Page_185" id="Page_185"></a>will stand on a three-cent piece, and then beat in three
eggs, yolks and whites beaten separately. Pour this
into a buttered earthen dish; bake in a quick oven, and
serve at once. In all cases where cheese disagrees it
will be found that the bi-carbonate of potash renders it
harmless.</p>


<p>TO BOIL OATMEAL OR CRUSHED WHEAT.</p>

<p>Have ready a quart of boiling water in a farina-boiler,
or use a small pail set in a saucepan of boiling water.
If oatmeal or any grain is boiled in a single saucepan,
it forms, no matter how often it is stirred, a thick crust
on the bottom; and, as <i>never to stir</i> is a cardinal rule for
all these preparations, let the next one be, a double boiler.</p>

<p>Add a teaspoonful of salt to the quart of water in the
inside boiler. Be sure it is boiling, and then throw in one
even cup of oatmeal or crushed wheat. Now <i>let it alone</i>
for two hours, only being sure that the water in the outside
saucepan does not dry away, but boils steadily.
When done, each grain should be distinct, yet jelly-like.
Stirring makes a mere mush, neither very attractive nor
palatable. If there is not time for this long boiling in
the morning, let it be done the afternoon before. Do
not turn out the oatmeal, but fill the outer boiler next
morning, and let it boil half an hour, or till heated
through.</p>


<p>COARSE HOMINY.</p>

<p>Treat like oatmeal, using same amount to a quart of
water, save that it must be thoroughly washed beforehand.
Three hours' boiling is better than two.<a name="Page_186" id="Page_186"></a></p>


<p>FINE HOMINY.</p>

<p>Allow a cupful to a quart of boiling, salted water.
Wash it in two or three waters, put over, and boil steadily
for half an hour, or till it will pour out easily. If too
thin, boil uncovered for a short time. Stir in a tablespoonful
of butter before sending to table. Any of these
preparations may be cut in slices when cold, floured on
each side, and fried brown like mush.</p>


<p>FINE HOMINY CAKES.</p>

<p>One pint of cold boiled hominy; two eggs; a saltspoonful
of salt; and a tablespoonful of butter melted.
Break up the hominy fine with a fork, and add salt and
butter. Beat the eggs,&mdash;whites and yolks separately;
add the yolks first, and last the whites; and either fry
brown in a little butter or drop by spoonfuls on buttered
plates, and bake brown in a quick oven. This is a nice
side-dish at dinner. Oatmeal and wheat can be used in
the same way at breakfast.</p>


<p>HASTY PUDDING, OR MUSH.</p>

<p>One cup of sifted Indian meal, stirred smooth in a
bowl with a little cold water. Have ready a quart of
boiling water, with a teaspoonful of salt, and pour in the
meal. Boil half an hour, or till it will just pour, stirring
often. To be eaten hot with butter and sirup. Rye or
graham flour can be used in the same way. If intended
to fry, pour the hot mush into a shallow pan which has
been wet with cold water to prevent its sticking. A
spoonful of butter may be added while hot, but is not
<a name="Page_187" id="Page_187"></a>necessary. Cut in thin slices when cold; flour each side;
and fry brown in a little butter or nice drippings, serving
hot.</p>


<p>WHAT TO DO WITH COLD POTATOES.</p>

<p>Chop, as for hash; melt a tablespoonful of either butter
or nice drippings in a frying-pan; add, for six or eight
good-sized potatoes, one even teaspoonful of salt and a
saltspoonful of pepper. When the fat boils, put in the
potatoes, and fry for about ten minutes, or until well
browned. As soon as they are done, if not ready to use,
move to the back of the stove, that they may not burn.</p>

<p>Or cut each potato in lengthwise slices; dredge on a
little flour; and fry brown on each side, watching carefully
that they do not burn. The fat from two or three slices
of fried salt pork may be used for these.</p>


<p>LYONNAISE POTATOES.</p>

<p>Slice six cold boiled potatoes. Mince very fine an
onion and two or three sprigs of parsley,&mdash;enough to
fill a teaspoon. Melt in a frying-pan a tablespoonful of
butter; put in the onion, and fry light brown; then add
the potatoes, and fry to a light brown also, turning them
often. Put into a hot dish, stirring in the minced parsley,
and pouring over them any butter that may be left in the
pan.</p>


<p>STEWED POTATOES.</p>

<p>One pint of cold boiled potatoes cut in bits; one cup of
milk; butter the size of an egg; a heaping teaspoonful
of flour. Melt the butter in a saucepan; add the flour,
and cook a moment; and pour in the milk, an even tea<a name="Page_188" id="Page_188"></a>spoonful
of salt, and a saltspoonful of white pepper.
When it boils, add the potatoes. Boil a minute, and
serve.</p>


<p>SARATOGA POTATOES.</p>

<p>Pare potatoes, and slice thin as wafers, either with a
potato-slicer or a thin-bladed, very sharp knife. Lay
in very cold water at least an hour before using. If for
breakfast, over-night is better. Have boiling lard at
least three inches deep in a frying kettle or pan. Dry
the potatoes thoroughly in a towel, and drop in a few
slices at a time, frying to a golden brown. Take out
with a skimmer, and lay on a double brown paper in
the oven to dry, salting them lightly. They may be
eaten either hot or cold. Three medium-sized potatoes
will make a large dishful; or, as they keep perfectly well,
enough may be done at once for several meals, heating
them a few minutes in the oven before using.</p>


<p>FISH BALLS.</p>

<p>One pint of cold salt fish, prepared as on page 136,
and chopped very fine. Eight good-sized, freshly-boiled
potatoes, or enough to make a quart when mashed. Mash
with half a teaspoonful of salt, and a heaping tablespoonful
of butter, and, if liked, a teaspoonful of made
mustard. Mix in the chopped fish, blending both thoroughly.
Make into small, round cakes; flour on each
side; and fry brown in a little drippings or fat of fried
pork. A nicer way is to make into round balls, allowing
a large tablespoonful to each. Roll in flour; or they can
be egged and crumbed like croquettes. Drop into boiling
lard; drain on brown paper, and serve hot. Fresh fish
<a name="Page_189" id="Page_189"></a>can be used in the same way, and is very nice. Breadcrumbs,
softened in milk, can be used instead of potato,
but are not so good.</p>


<p>FISH HASH.</p>

<p>Use either fresh fish or salt. If the former, double
the measure of salt will be needed. Prepare and mix as
in fish balls, allowing always double the amount of fresh
mashed potato that you have of fish. Melt a large spoonful
of butter or drippings in a frying-pan. When hot,
put in the fish. Let it stand till brown on the bottom, and
then stir. Do this two or three times, letting it brown at
the last, pressing it into omelet form, and turning out on a
hot platter, or piling it lightly.</p>


<p>FISH WITH CREAM.</p>

<p>One pint of cold minced fish, either salt cod or fresh
fish; always doubling the amount of seasoning given if
fresh is used. Melt in a frying-pan a tablespoonful of
butter; stir in a heaping one of flour, and cook a minute;
then add a pint of milk and a saltspoonful each of salt
and pepper. When it boils, stir in the fish, and add two
well-beaten eggs. Cook for a minute, and serve very hot.</p>

<p>Cold salmon, or that put up unspiced, is nice done in
this way. The eggs can be omitted, but it is not as good.
If cream is plenty, use part cream. Any cold boiled
fresh fish can be used in this way.</p>


<p>SALT MACKEREL OR ROE HERRING.</p>

<p>Soak over-night, the skin-side up. In the morning
wipe dry, and either broil, as in general directions for
<a name="Page_190" id="Page_190"></a>broiling fish, page 133, or fry brown in pork fat or
drippings.</p>

<p>Salted shad are treated in the same way. All are
better broiled.</p>


<p>FRIED SAUSAGES.</p>

<p>If in skins, prick them all over with a large darning-needle
or fork; throw them into a saucepan of boiling
water and boil for one minute. Take out, wipe dry, and
lay in a hot frying-pan, in which has been melted a tablespoonful
of hot lard or drippings. Turn often. As soon
as brown they are done. If gravy is wanted, stir a tablespoonful
of flour into the fat in the pan; add a cup of
boiling water, and salt to taste,&mdash;about a saltspoonful,&mdash;and
pour, not <i>over</i>, but around the sausages. Serve
hot.</p>


<p>FRIZZLED BEEF.</p>

<p>Half a pound of smoked beef cut very thin. This can
be just heated in a tablespoonful of hot butter, and then
served, or prepared as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>Pour boiling water on the beef, and let it stand five
minutes. In the meantime melt in a frying-pan one
tablespoonful of butter; stir in a tablespoonful of flour,
and add slowly half a pint of milk or water. Put in the
beef which has been taken from the water; cook a few
minutes, and add two or three well-beaten eggs, cooking
only a minute longer. It can be prepared without eggs,
or they may be added to the beef just heated in butter;
but the last method is best.<a name="Page_191" id="Page_191"></a></p>


<p>VEAL LOAF.</p>

<p>Three pounds of lean veal and quarter of a pound of
salt pork chopped very fine. Mince an onion as fine as
possible. Grate a nutmeg, or use half a teaspoonful of
powdered mace, mixing it with an even tablespoonful
of salt, and an even saltspoonful of cayenne pepper.
Add three well-beaten eggs, a teacupful of milk, and a
large spoonful of melted butter. Mix the ingredients very
thoroughly; form into a loaf; cover thickly with sifted
bread or cracker crumbs, and bake three hours, basting
now and then with a little butter and water. When cold,
cut in thin slices, and use for breakfast or tea. It is
good for breakfast with baked potatoes, and slices of it
are sometimes served around a salad. A glass of wine is
sometimes added before baking.</p>


<p>MEAT HASH.</p>

<p>The English hash is meat cut either in slices or mouthfuls,
and warmed in the gravy; and the Southern hash
is the same. A genuine hash, however, requires potato,
and may be made of any sort of meat; cold roast beef
being excellent, and cold corned beef best of all. Mutton
is good; but veal should always be used as a mince, and
served on toast as in the rule to be given.</p>

<p>Chop the meat fine, and allow one-third meat to two-thirds
potato. For corned-beef hash the potatoes should
be freshly boiled and mashed. For other cold meats
finely-chopped cold potatoes will answer. To a quart of
the mixture allow a teaspoonful of salt and half a teaspoonful
of pepper mixed together, and sprinkled on the
meat before chopping. Heat a tablespoonful of butter or
nice drippings in a frying-pan; moisten the hash with a
<a name="Page_192" id="Page_192"></a>little cold gravy or water; and heat slowly, stirring often.
It may be served on buttered toast when hot, without
browning, but is better browned. To accomplish this,
first heat through, then set on the back of the stove, and
let it stand twenty minutes. Fold like an omelet, or turn
out in a round, and serve hot.</p>


<p>MINCED VEAL.</p>

<p>Chop cold veal fine, picking out all bits of gristle. To
a pint-bowlful allow a large cup of boiling water; a tablespoonful
of butter and one of flour; a teaspoonful of
salt; and a saltspoonful each of pepper and mace. Make
a <i>roux</i> with the butter and flour, and add the seasoning;
put in the veal, and cook five minutes, serving it on buttered
toast, made as in directions given for water toast.</p>


<p>TOAST, DRY OR BUTTERED.</p>

<p>Not one person in a hundred makes good toast; yet
nothing can be simpler. Cut the slices of bread evenly,
and rather thin. If a wire toaster is used, several can
be done at once. Hold just far enough from the fire to
brown nicely; and turn often, that there may be no
scorching. Toast to an even, golden brown. No rule
will secure this, and only experience and care will teach
one just what degree of heat will do it. If to be
buttered dry, butter each slice evenly as taken from the
fire, and pile on a hot plate. If served without butter,
either send to table in a toast-rack, or, if on a plate, do
not pile together, but let the slices touch as little as possible,
that they may not steam and lose crispness.<a name="Page_193" id="Page_193"></a></p>


<p>WATER TOAST.</p>

<p>Have a pan of boiling hot, well-salted water; a teaspoonful
to a quart being the invariable rule. Dip each
slice of toast quickly into this. It must not be <i>wet</i>, but
only moistened. Butter, and pile on a hot plate. Poached
eggs and minces are served on this form of toast, which
is also nice with fricasseed chicken.</p>


<p>MILK TOAST.</p>

<p>Scald a quart of milk in a double boiler, and thicken it
with two even tablespoonfuls of corn-starch dissolved in a
little cold water, or the same amount of flour. Add a
teaspoonful of salt, and a heaping tablespoonful of butter.
Have ready a dozen slices of water toast, which, unless
wanted quite rich, needs no butter. Pour the thickened
milk into a pan, that each slice may be easily dipped into
it, and pile them when dipped in a deep dish, pouring the
rest of the milk over them. Serve very hot. Cream is
sometimes used instead of milk, in which case no thickening
is put in, and only a pint heated with a saltspoonful
of salt.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />



<h2><a name="TEA_COFFEE_ETC" id="TEA_COFFEE_ETC" />TEA, COFFEE, ETC.</h2>

<p>For these a cardinal rule has already been given in
Part I., but can not be enforced too often; viz., the necessity
of fresh water boiled, and used as soon as it boils,
that the gases which give it character and sparkle may
not have had time to escape. Tea and coffee both should
be kept from the air, but the former even more carefully
<a name="Page_194" id="Page_194"></a>than the latter, as the delicate flavor evaporates more
quickly.</p>


<p>TEA.</p>

<p>To begin with, never use a tin teapot if an earthen
one is obtainable. An even teaspoonful of dry tea is
the usual allowance for a person. Scald the teapot with
a little <i>boiling water</i>, and pour it off. Put in the tea,
and pour on not over a cup of boiling water, letting it
stand a minute or two for the leaves to swell. Then fill
with the needed amount of <i>water still boiling</i>, this being
about a small cupful to a person. Cover closely, and let it
stand five minutes. Ten will be required for English
breakfast tea, but <i>never boil</i> either, above all in a tin pot.
Boiling liberates the tannic acid of the tea, which acts
upon the tin, making a compound bitter and metallic in
taste, and unfit for human stomachs.</p>


<p>COFFEE.</p>

<p>The best coffee is made from a mixture of two-thirds
Java and one-third Mocha; the Java giving strength,
and the Mocha flavor and aroma. The roasting must be
very perfectly done. If done at home, constant stirring
is necessary to prevent burning; but all good grocers
use now rotary roasters, which brown each grain perfectly.
Buy in small quantities <i>unground</i>; keep closely
covered; and if the highest flavor is wanted, heat hot before
grinding.</p>

<p>A noted German chemist claims to have discovered an
effectual antidote to the harmful effects of coffee,&mdash;an
antidote for which he had searched for years. In his experiments
he discovered that the fibre of cotton, in its natural
<a name="Page_195" id="Page_195"></a>state before bleaching, neutralizes the harmful principle of
the caffein. To make absolutely harmless coffee which yet
has no loss of flavor, it is to be boiled in a bag of unbleached
cheese-cloth or something equally porous. In the coffee-pot
of his invention, the rounds of cotton are slipped
between two cylinders of tin, and the boiling water is
poured through once or twice, on the same principle as
French filtered coffee. The cloths must be rinsed in hot
and then cold water daily and carefully dried; and none
are to be used longer than one week, as at the end of that
time, even with careful washing, the fibre is saturated
with the harmful principle. The same proportions of
coffee as those given below are used, and the pot must
stand in a hot place while the water filters through.</p>

<p>For a quart of coffee allow four heaping tablespoonfuls
of coffee when ground. Scald the coffee-pot; mix the
ground coffee with a little cold water and two or three
egg-shells, which can be dried and kept for this purpose.
Part of a fresh egg with the shell is still better. Put into
the hot coffee-pot, and pour on one quart of <i>boiling water</i>.
Cover tightly, and boil five minutes; then pour out a cupful
to free the spout from grounds, and return this to the
pot. Let it stand a few minutes to settle, and serve with
boiled milk, and cream if it is to be had. Never for
appearance's sake decant coffee. Much of the flavor is
lost by turning from one pot into another, and the shapes
are now sufficiently pretty to make the block tin ones not
at all unpresentable at table.</p>

<p>Where coffee is required for a large company, allow a
pound and a half to a gallon of water.</p>

<p>Coffee made in a French filter or biggin is considered
better by many; but I have preferred to give a rule that
<a name="Page_196" id="Page_196"></a>may be used with certainty where French cooking utensils
are unknown.</p>


<p>COCOA, BROMA, AND SHELLS.</p>

<p>The directions found on packages of these articles are
always reliable. The <i>cocoa</i> or <i>broma</i> should be mixed
smoothly with a little boiling water, and added to that in
the saucepan; one quart of either requiring a pint each
of milk and water, about three tablespoonfuls of cocoa, and
a small cup of sugar. A pinch of salt is always a great
improvement. Boil for half an hour.</p>

<p>SHELLS are merely the husk of the cocoa-nut; and a
cupful to a quart of boiling water is the amount needed.
Boil steadily an hour, and use with milk and sugar.</p>


<p>CHOCOLATE.</p>

<p>This rule, though unlike that given in cook-books generally,
makes a drink in consistency and flavor like that
offered at Maillard's or Mendee's, the largest chocolate
manufacturers in the country.</p>

<p>Scrape or grate fine two squares (two ounces) of Baker's
or any unsweetened chocolate. Add to this one small cup
of sugar and a pinch of salt, and put into a saucepan with
a tablespoonful of water. Stir for a few minutes till
smooth and glossy, and then pour in gradually one pint
of milk and one of boiling water. Let all boil a minute.
Dissolve one heaping teaspoonful of corn-starch or arrow-root
in a little cold water, and add to the chocolate. Boil
one minute, and serve. If cream can be had, whip to a
stiff froth, allowing two tablespoonfuls of sugar and a
few drops of vanilla essence to a cup of cream. Serve
a spoonful laid on the top of the chocolate in each cup.<a name="Page_197" id="Page_197"></a>
The corn-starch may be omitted, but is necessary to the
perfection of this rule, the following of which renders
the chocolate not only smooth, but entirely free from
any oily particles. Flavor is lost by any longer boiling,
though usually half an hour has been considered
necessary.</p>

<h2><a name="VEGETABLES" id="VEGETABLES" />VEGETABLES.</h2>


<p>POTATOES.</p>

<p>To be able to boil a potato perfectly is one of the
tests of a good cook, there being nothing in the whole
range of vegetables which is apparently so difficult to
accomplish. Like the making of good bread, nothing is
simpler when once learned. A good boiled potato should
be white, mealy, and served very hot. If the potatoes
are old, peel thinly with a sharp knife; cut out all spots,
and let them lie in cold water some hours before using.
It is more economical to boil before peeling, as the best
part of the potato lies next the skin; but most prefer them
peeled. Put on in boiling water, allowing a teaspoonful
of salt to every quart of water. Medium-sized potatoes
will boil in half an hour. Let them be as nearly of a size
as possible, and if small and large are cooked at the same
time, put on the large ones ten or fifteen minutes before
the small. When done, pour off every drop of water;
cover with a clean towel, and set on the back of the range
to dry for a few minutes before serving. The poorest
potato can be made tolerable by this treatment. Never
let them wait for other things, but time the preparation of
dinner so that they will be ready at the moment needed.<a name="Page_198" id="Page_198"></a>
New potatoes require no peeling, but should merely be
well washed and rubbed.</p>


<p>MASHED POTATOES.</p>

<p>Boil as directed, and when dry and mealy, mash fine
with a potato-masher or large spoon, allowing for a dozen
medium-sized potatoes a piece of butter the size of an
egg, half a cup of milk, a teaspoonful of salt, and half a
teaspoonful of white pepper. The milk may be omitted
if the potato is preferred dry. Pile lightly in a dish, or
smooth over, and serve at once. Never brown in the
oven, as it destroys the good flavor.</p>


<p>POTATO SNOW.</p>

<p>Mash as above, and rub through a colander into a very
hot dish, being careful not to press it down in any way,
and serve hot as possible.</p>


<p>BAKED POTATOES.</p>

<p>Wash and scrub carefully, as some persons eat the
skin. A large potato requires an hour to bake. Their
excellence depends upon being eaten the moment they are
done.</p>


<p>POTATOES WITH BEEF.</p>

<p>Pare, and lay in cold water at least an hour. An hour
before a roast of beef is done, lay in the pan, and baste
them when the beef is basted. They are very nice.</p>

<p>POTATO CROQUETTES.</p>

<p>Cold mashed potatoes may be used, but fresh is better.
To half a dozen potatoes, mashed as in directions given,
<a name="Page_199" id="Page_199"></a>allow quarter of a saltspoonful each of mace or nutmeg
and cayenne pepper, and one beaten egg. Make in little
balls or rolls; egg and crumb, and fry in boiling lard.
Drain on brown paper, and serve like chicken croquettes.</p>


<p>SWEET POTATOES.</p>

<p>Wash carefully, and boil without peeling from three-quarters
of an hour to an hour. Peel, and dry in the oven
ten minutes. They are better baked, requiring about an
hour for medium-sized ones.</p>


<p>BEETS.</p>

<p>Winter beets should be soaked over-night. Wash them
carefully; but never peel or even prick them, as color and
sweetness would be lost. Put in boiling, salted water.
Young beets will cook in two hours; old ones require
five or six. Peel, and if large, cut in slices, putting a
little butter on each one. They can be served cold in a
little vinegar.</p>


<p>PARSNIPS.</p>

<p>Wash, and scrape clean; cut lengthwise in halves, and
boil an hour, or two if very old. Serve whole with a
little drawn butter, or mash fine, season well, allowing to
half a dozen large parsnips a teaspoonful of salt, a saltspoonful
of pepper, and a tablespoonful of butter.</p>


<p>PARSNIP FRITTERS.</p>

<p>Three large parsnips boiled and mashed fine, adding
two well-beaten eggs, half a teaspoonful of salt, a saltspoonful
of pepper, two tablespoonfuls of milk, and one
heaping one of flour. Drop in spoonfuls, and fry brown in
a little hot butter. <i>Oyster-plant</i> fritters are made in the
same way.<a name="Page_200" id="Page_200"></a></p>


<p>OYSTER-PLANT STEWED.</p>

<p>Scrape, and throw at once into cold water with a little
vinegar in it, to keep them from turning black. Cut in
small pieces, or boil whole for an hour. Mash fine, and
make like parsnip fritters; or drain the pieces dry, and
serve with drawn butter.</p>


<p>CARROTS.</p>

<p>Carrots are most savory boiled with corned beef for two
hours. They may also be boiled plain, cut in slices, and
served with drawn butter. For old carrots not less than
two hours will be necessary. Plenty of water must be
used, and when cold the carrots are to be cut in dice.
Melt in a saucepan a spoonful of butter; add half a teaspoonful
of salt, a saltspoonful of pepper, and a teaspoonful
of sugar, and when the butter boils put in the carrots,
and stir till heated through. Pile them in the centre of a
platter, and put around them a can of French peas, which
have been cooked in only a spoonful of water, with a teaspoonful
of sugar, a spoonful of butter, half a teaspoonful
of salt, and a dash of pepper. This is a pretty and
excellent dish, and substantial as meat. A cup of stock
can be added to the carrots if desired, but they are better
without it.</p>


<p>TURNIPS.</p>

<p>Pare and cut in quarters. Boil in well-salted water for
an hour, or until tender. Drain off the water, and let
them stand a few minutes to dry; then mash fine, allowing
for about a quart a teaspoonful of salt, half a one of
pepper, and a piece of butter the size of a walnut.</p>

<p>Or they may be left in pieces, and served with drawn
butter.<a name="Page_201" id="Page_201"></a></p>


<p>CABBAGE.</p>

<p>Wash, and look over very carefully, and lay in cold
water an hour. Cut in quarters, and boil with corned beef
an hour, or till tender, or with a small piece of salt pork.
Drain, and serve whole as possible. A much nicer way is
to boil in well-salted water, changing it once after the first
half-hour. Boil an hour; take up and drain; chop fine,
and add a teacupful of milk, a piece of butter the size of
an egg, a teaspoonful of salt, and half a one of pepper.
Serve very hot. For cabbage Virginia fashion, and the
best of fashions, too, bake this last form in a buttered
pudding-dish, having first stirred in two or three well-beaten
eggs, and covered the top with bread-crumbs.
Bake till brown.</p>


<p>CAULIFLOWER.</p>

<p>Wash and trim, and boil in a bag made of mosquito-netting
to keep it whole. Boil steadily in well-salted water
for one hour. Dish carefully, and pour over it a nice
drawn butter. Any cold remains may be used as salad,
or chopped and baked, as in rule for baked cabbage.</p>


<p>ONIONS.</p>

<p>If milk is plenty, use equal quantities of skim-milk and
water, allowing a quart of each for a dozen or so large
onions. If water alone is used, change it after the first
half-hour, as this prevents their turning dark; salting as
for all vegetables, and boiling young onions one hour;
old ones, two. Either chop fine, and add a spoonful of
butter, half a teaspoonful of salt, and a little pepper, or
serve them whole in a dressing made by heating one cup
<a name="Page_202" id="Page_202"></a>of milk with the same butter and other seasoning as when
chopped. Put the onions in a hot dish, pour this over
them, and serve. They may also be half boiled; then put
in a buttered dish, covered with this sauce and a layer of
bread-crumbs, and baked for an hour.</p>


<p>WINTER SQUASH.</p>

<p>Cut in two, and take out the seeds and fiber. Half will
probably be enough to cook at once. Cut this in pieces;
pare off the rind, and lay each piece in a steamer. Never
boil in water if it can be avoided, as it must be as dry as
possible. Steam for two hours. Mash fine, or run
through a vegetable sifter, and, for a quart or so of squash,
allow a piece of butter the size of an egg, a teaspoonful
of salt, and a saltspoonful of pepper. Serve very hot.</p>


<p>SUMMER SQUASH, OR CIMLINS.</p>

<p>Steam as directed above, taking out the seeds, but not
peeling them. Mash through a colander; season, and
serve hot. If very young, the seeds are often cooked in
them. Half an hour will be sufficient.</p>


<p>PEASE.</p>

<p>Shell, and put over in boiling, salted water, to which a
teaspoonful of sugar has been added. Boil till tender,
half an hour or a little more. Drain off the water; add a
piece of butter the size of an egg, and a saltspoonful of
salt. If the pease are old, put a bit of soda the size of a
pea in the water.</p>


<p>FIELD PEASE.</p>

<p>These are generally used after drying. Soak over-night,
and boil two hours, or till tender, with or without a small
<a name="Page_203" id="Page_203"></a>piece of bacon. If without, butter as for green pease.
Or they can be mashed fine, rubbed through a sieve, and
then seasoned, adding a pinch of cayenne pepper.</p>

<p>In Virginia they are often boiled, mashed a little, and
fried in a large cake.</p>


<p>SUCCOTASH.</p>

<p>Boil green corn and beans separately. Cut the corn
from the cob, and season both as in either alone. A
nicer way, however, is to score the rows in half a dozen
ears of corn; scrape off the corn; add a pint of lima or
any nice green bean, and boil one hour in a quart of
boiling water, with one teaspoonful each of salt and sugar,
and a saltspoonful of pepper. Let the water boil away
to about a cupful; add a spoonful of butter, and serve
in a hot dish. Many, instead of butter, use with it a
small piece of pork,&mdash;about quarter of a pound; but it
is better without. A spoonful of cream may be added.
Canned corn and beans may be used; and even dried
beans and coarse hominy&mdash;the former well soaked, and
both boiled together three hours&mdash;are very good.</p>


<p>STRING BEANS.</p>

<p>String, cut in bits, and boil an hour if very young. If
old, an hour and an half, or even two, may be needed.
Drain off the water, and season like green pease.</p>


<p>SHELLED BEANS.</p>

<p>Any green bean may be used in this way, lima and
butter beans being the nicest. Put on in boiling, salted
water, and boil not less than one hour. Season like
string beans.<a name="Page_204" id="Page_204"></a></p>


<p>GREEN CORN.</p>

<p>Husk, and pick off all the silk. Boil in well-salted
water, and serve on the cob, wrapped in a napkin, or cut
off and seasoned like beans. Cutting down through each
row gives, when scraped off, the kernel without the hull.</p>


<p>GREEN-CORN FRITTERS.</p>

<p>One pint of green corn grated. This will require about
six ears. Mix with this, half a cup of milk, two well-beaten
eggs, half a cup of flour, one teaspoonful of salt,
half a teaspoonful of pepper, and a tablespoonful of
melted butter. Fry in very small cakes in a little hot
butter, browning well on both sides. Serve very hot.</p>


<p>CORN PUDDING.</p>

<p>One pint of cut or grated corn, one pint of milk, two
well-beaten eggs, one teaspoonful of salt, and a saltspoonful
of pepper. Butter a pudding-dish, and bake
the mixture half an hour. Canned corn can be used in
the same way.</p>


<p>EGG-PLANT.</p>

<p>Peel, cut in slices half an inch thick, and lay them in
well-salted water for an hour. Wipe dry; dip in flour or
meal, and fry brown on each side. Fifteen minutes will
be needed to cook sufficiently. The slices can be egged
and crumbed before frying, and are nicer than when
merely floured.</p>


<p>EGG-PLANT FRITTERS.</p>

<p>Peel the egg-plant, and take out the seeds. Boil for an
hour in well-salted water. Drain as dry as possible;
mash fine, and prepare precisely like corn fritters.<a name="Page_205" id="Page_205"></a></p>


<p>BAKED EGG-PLANT.</p>

<p>Peel, and cut out a piece from the top; remove the
seeds, and fill the space with a dressing like that for
ducks, fitting in the piece cut out. Bake an hour, basting
with a spoonful of butter melted in a cup of water, and
dredging with flour between each basting. It is very nice.</p>


<p>ASPARAGUS.</p>

<p>Wash, and cut off almost all of the white end. Tie up
in small bundles; put into boiling, salted water, and cook
till tender,&mdash;about half an hour, or more if old.</p>

<p>Make some slices of water toast, as in rule given, using
the water in which the asparagus was boiled; lay the
slices on a hot platter, and the asparagus upon them,
pouring a spoonful of melted butter over it. The asparagus
may be cut in little bits, and, when boiled, a drawn
butter poured over it, or served on toast, as when left
whole. Cold asparagus may be cut fine, and used in an
omelet, or simply warmed over.</p>


<p>SPINACH.</p>

<p>Not less than a peck is needed for a dinner for three or
four. Pick over carefully, wash, and let it lie in cold
water an hour or two. Put on in boiling, salted water,
and boil an hour, or until tender. Take up in a colander,
that it may drain perfectly. Have in a hot dish a piece of
butter the size of an egg, half a teaspoonful of salt, a
saltspoonful of pepper, and, if liked, a tablespoonful of
vinegar. Chop the spinach fine, and put in the dish, stirring
in this dressing thoroughly. A teacupful of cream is
often added. Any tender greens, beet or turnip tops,
kale, &amp;c., are treated in this way; kale, however, requiring
two hours' boiling.<a name="Page_206" id="Page_206"></a></p>


<p>ARTICHOKES.</p>

<p>Cut off the outside leaves; trim the bottom; throw into
boiling, salted water, with a teaspoonful of vinegar in it,
and boil an hour. Season, and serve like turnips, or with
drawn butter poured over them.</p>


<p>TOMATOES STEWED.</p>

<p>Pour on boiling water to take off the skins; cut in
pieces, and stew slowly for half an hour; adding for a
dozen tomatoes a tablespoonful of butter, a teaspoonful
of salt, a saltspoonful of pepper, and a teaspoonful of
sugar. Where they are preferred sweet, two tablespoonfuls
of sugar will be necessary. They may be thickened
with a tablespoonful of flour or corn-starch dissolved in a
little cold water, or with half a cup of rolled cracker or
bread crumbs. Canned tomatoes are stewed in the same
way.</p>


<p>BAKED TOMATOES.</p>

<p>Take off the skins; lay the tomatoes in a buttered
pudding-dish; put a bit of butter on each one. Mix a
teaspoonful of salt, and a saltspoonful of pepper, with a
cup of bread or cracker crumbs, and cover the top. Bake
an hour.</p>

<p>Or cut the tomatoes in bits, and put a layer of them
and one of seasoned crumbs, ending with crumbs. Dot
the top with bits of butter, that it may brown well, and
bake in the same way. Canned tomatoes are almost
equally good. Thin slices of well-buttered bread may be
used instead of crumbs.</p>


<p>FRIED TOMATOES.</p>

<p>Cut in thick slices. Mix in a plate half a teacupful of
<a name="Page_207" id="Page_207"></a>flour, a saltspoonful of salt, and half a one of pepper;
and dip each slice in this, frying brown in hot butter.</p>


<p>BROILED TOMATOES.</p>

<p>Prepare as for frying, and broil in a wire broiler, putting
a bit of butter on each slice when brown, and serving on
a hot dish or on buttered toast.</p>


<p>RICE.</p>

<p>Wash in cold water, changing it at least twice. It is
better if allowed to soak an hour. Drain, and throw into
a good deal of boiling, salted water, allowing not less than
two quarts to a cupful of rice. Boil twenty minutes, stirring
now and then. Pour into a colander, that every drop
of water may drain off, and then set it at the back of the
stove to dry for ten minutes. In this way every grain is
distinct, yet perfectly tender. If old, half an hour's
boiling may be required. Test by biting a grain at the
end of twenty minutes. If tender, it is done.</p>


<p>RICE CROQUETTES.</p>

<p>Where used as a vegetable with dinner, to a pint of
cold boiled rice allow a tablespoonful of melted butter
and one or two well-beaten eggs. Mix thoroughly. A
pinch of cayenne or a little chopped parsley may be added.
Make in the shape of corks; egg and crumb, and fry a
golden brown.</p>


<p>MACARONI.</p>

<p>Never wash macaroni if it can be avoided. Break in
lengths of three or four inches and throw into boiling,
salted water, allowing quarter of a pound for a dinner for
three or four. Boil for half an hour, and drain off the
<a name="Page_208" id="Page_208"></a>water. It may be served plain with tomato sauce, or
simply buttered, or with drawn butter poured over it.</p>


<p>MACARONI WITH CHEESE.</p>

<p>Boil as directed. Make a pint of white sauce or <i>roux</i>,
as on p. 169, using milk if it can be had, though water
answers. Have a cupful of good grated cheese. Butter
a pudding-dish. Put in a layer of macaroni, one of
sauce, and one of cheese, ending with cheese. Dust the
top with sifted bread or cracker crumbs, dot with bits of
butter, and bake fifteen minutes in a quick oven. It can
be baked in the same way without cheese, or with simply
a cup of milk and two eggs added, making a sort of pudding.</p>

<h2><a name="BREAD_AND_BREAKFAST_CAKES" id="BREAD_AND_BREAKFAST_CAKES" />BREAD AND BREAKFAST CAKES.</h2>

<p>BREAD-MAKING AND FLOUR.</p>


<p>Much of the health, and consequently much of the
happiness, of the family depends upon good bread: therefore
no pains should be spared in learning the best method
of making, which will prove easiest in the end.</p>

<p>Yeast, flour, kneading, and baking must each be perfect,
and nothing in the whole range of cooking is of such
prime importance.</p>

<p>Once master the problem of yeast, and the first form of
wheat bread, and endless varieties of both bread and
breakfast cakes can be made.</p>

<p>The old and the new process flour&mdash;the former being
known as the St. Louis, and the latter as Haxall flour&mdash;are<a name="Page_209" id="Page_209"></a>
now to be had at all good grocers; and from either
good bread may be made, though that from the latter
keeps moist longer. Potapsco flour is of the same quality
as the St. Louis. It contains more starch than the St.
Louis, and for this reason requires, even more than that,
the use in the family of coarser or graham flour at the
same time; white bread alone not being as nutritious or
strengthening, for reasons given in Part I. Graham flour
is fast being superseded by a much better form, prepared
principally by the Health Food Company in New York,
in which the entire grain, save the husk, is ground as fine
as the ordinary flour, thus doing away with the coarseness
that many have objected to in graham bread.</p>

<p>Flour made by the new process swells more than that
by the old, and a little less quantity&mdash;about an eighth
less&mdash;is therefore required in mixing and kneading. As
definite rules as possible are given for the whole operation;
but experience alone can insure perfect bread, changes of
temperature affecting it at once, and baking being also a
critical point.</p>

<p>Pans made of thick tin, or, better still, of Russia iron,
ten inches long, four or five wide, and four deep, make
the best-shaped loaf, and one requiring a reasonably short
time to bake.</p>


<p>YEAST.</p>

<p>Ingredients: One teacupful of lightly broken hops; one
pint of sifted flour; one cupful of sugar; one tablespoonful
of salt; four large or six medium-sized potatoes; and
two quarts of boiling water.</p>

<p>Boil the potatoes, and mash them fine. At the same
time, having tied the hops in a little bag, boil them for
half an hour in the two quarts of water, but in another
<a name="Page_210" id="Page_210"></a>saucepan. Mix the flour, sugar, and salt well together in
a large mixing-bowl, and pour on the boiling hop-water,
stirring constantly. Now add enough of this to the mashed
potato to thin it till it can be poured, and mix all together,
straining it through a sieve to avoid any possible lumps.
Add to this, when cool, either a cupful of yeast left from
the last, or of baker's yeast, or a Twin Brothers' yeast
cake dissolved in a little warm water. Let it stand till
partly light, and then stir down two or three times in the
course of five or six hours, as this makes it stronger. At
the end of that time it will be light. Keep in a covered
stone jar, or in glass cans. By stirring in corn-meal till a
dough is made, and then forming it in small cakes and
drying in the sun, <i>dry yeast</i> is made, which keeps better
than the liquid in hot weather. Crumb, and soak in warm
water half an hour before using.</p>

<p><i>Potato yeast</i> is made by omitting hops and flour, but
mashing the potatoes fine with the same proportion of
other ingredients, and adding the old yeast, when cool, as
before. It is very nice, but must be made fresh every
week; while the other, kept in a cool place, will be good
a month.</p>


<p>BREAD.</p>

<p>For four loaves of bread of the pan-size given above,
allow as follows: Four quarts of flour; one large cup of
yeast; one tablespoonful of salt, one of sugar, and one of
butter or lard; one pint of milk mixed with one of warm
water, or one quart of water alone for the &quot;wetting.&quot;</p>

<p>Sift the flour into a large pan or bowl. Put the sugar,
salt, and butter in the bottom of the bread pan or bowl,
and pour on a spoonful or two of boiling water, enough to
dissolve all. Add the quart of wetting, and the yeast.<a name="Page_211" id="Page_211"></a>
Now stir in slowly two quarts of the flour; cover with a
cloth, and set in a temperature of about 75&deg; to rise until
morning. Bread mixed at nine in the evening will be
ready to mould into loaves or rolls by six the next morning.
In summer it would be necessary to find a cool
place; in winter a warm one,&mdash;the chief point being to
keep the temperature <i>even</i>. If mixed early in the morning,
it is ready to mold and bake in the afternoon, from seven
to eight hours being all it should stand.</p>

<p>This first mixture is called a <i>sponge</i>; and, if only a loaf
of graham or rye bread is wanted, one quart of it can be
measured, and thickened with other flour as in the rules
given hereafter.</p>

<p>To finish as <i>wheat bread</i>, stir in enough flour from the
two quarts remaining to make a dough. Flour the molding-board
very thickly, and turn out. Now begin kneading,
flouring the hands, but after the dough is gathered
into a smooth lump, using as little flour as may be. Knead
with the palm of the hand as much as possible. The
dough quickly becomes a flat cake. Fold it over, and keep
on, kneading not less than twenty minutes; half an hour
being better.</p>

<p>Make into loaves; put into the pans; set them in a
warm place, and let them rise from thirty to forty-five
minutes, or till they have become nearly double in size.
Bake in an oven hot enough to brown a teaspoonful of
flour in one minute; spreading the flour on a bit of broken
plate, that it may have an even heat. Loaves of this size
will bake in from forty-five to sixty minutes. Then take
them from the pans; wrap in thick cloths kept for the
purpose and stand them, tilted up against the pans till
cold. Never lay hot bread on a pine table, as it will sweat,
<a name="Page_212" id="Page_212"></a>and absorb the pitchy odor and taste; but tilt, so that air
may pass around it freely. Keep well covered in a tin
box or large stone pot, which should be wiped out every
day or two, and scalded and dried thoroughly now and
then. Pans for wheat bread should be greased very lightly;
for graham or rye, much more, as the dough sticks
and clings.</p>

<p>Instead of mixing a sponge, all the flour may be molded
in and kneaded at once, and the dough set to rise in the
same way. When light, turn out. Use as little flour as
possible, and knead for fifteen minutes; less time being
required, as part of the kneading has already been done.</p>


<p>GRAHAM BREAD.</p>

<p>One quart of wheat sponge; one even quart of graham
flour; half a teacupful of brown sugar or molasses; half
a teaspoonful of soda dissolved in a little hot water; and
half a teaspoonful of salt.</p>

<p>Pour the sponge in a deep bowl; stir in the molasses,
&amp;c, and lastly the flour, which must never be sifted.
The mixture should be so stiff, that the spoon moves
with difficulty. Bake in two loaves for an hour or an
hour and a quarter, graham requiring longer baking than
wheat.</p>

<p>If no sponge can be spared, make as follows: One pint
of milk or water; half a cup of sugar or molasses; half
a cup of yeast; one teaspoonful of salt; one cup of
wheat flour; two cups of graham. Warm the milk or
water; add the yeast and other ingredients, and then the
flour; and set in a cool place&mdash;about 60&deg; Fahrenheit&mdash;over-night,
graham bread souring more easily than wheat.
Early in the morning stir well; put into two deep, well-<a name="Page_213" id="Page_213"></a>greased
pans; let it rise an hour in a warm place, and
bake one hour.</p>


<p>GRAHAM MUFFINS.</p>

<p>These are made by the same rule as the bread. Fill
the muffin-pans two-thirds full; let them rise till even
with the top of the pans, which will take about an hour;
and bake in a quick oven twenty minutes. To make
them a little nicer, a large spoonful of melted butter may
be added, and two beaten eggs. This will require longer
to rise, as butter clogs the air-cells, and makes the working
of the yeast slower. The quantities given for bread
will make two dozen muffins.</p>


<p>RYE BREAD.</p>

<p>This bread is made by nearly the same rule as the
graham, either using wheat sponge, or setting one over-night,
but is kneaded slightly. Follow the rule just given,
substituting rye for graham, but use enough rye to make
a dough which can be turned out. It will take a quart.
Use wheat flour for the molding-board and hands, as rye
is very sticky; and knead only long enough to get into
good shape. Raise, and bake as in rule for graham
bread.</p>


<p>RYE MUFFINS.</p>

<p>Make by above rule, but use only one pint of rye flour,
adding two eggs and a spoonful of melted butter, and
baking in the same way. A set of earthen cups are excellent
for both these and graham muffins, as the heat in
baking is more even. They are used also for pop-overs,
Sunderland puddings, and some small cakes.<a name="Page_214" id="Page_214"></a></p>


<p>BROWN BREAD.</p>

<p>Sift together into a deep bowl one even cup of Indian
meal, two heaping cups of rye flour, one even teaspoonful
of salt, and one of soda. To one pint of hot water
add one cup of molasses, and stir till well mixed. Make
a hole in the middle of the meal, and stir in the molasses
and water, beating all till smooth. Butter a tin pudding-boiler,
or a three-pint tin pail, and put in the mixture,
setting the boiler into a kettle or saucepan of boiling
water. Boil steadily for four hours, keeping the water
always at the same level. At the end of that time, take
out the boiler, and set in the oven for fifteen minutes to
dry and form a crust. Turn out, and serve hot.</p>

<p>Milk may be used instead of water, or the same mixture
raised over-night with half a cup of yeast, and then
steamed.</p>


<p>PLAIN ROLLS.</p>

<p>A pint-bowlful of bread dough will make twelve small
rolls. Increase amount of dough if more are desired.
Flour the molding-board lightly, and work into the dough
a piece of butter or lard the size of an egg. Knead not
less than fifteen minutes, and cut into round cakes, which
may be flattened and folded over, if folded or pocket rolls
are wanted. In this case put a bit of butter or lard the
size of a pea between the folds. For a cleft or French
roll make the dough into small round balls, and press a
knife-handle almost through the center of each. Put
them about an inch apart in well-buttered pans, and let
them rise an hour and a half before baking. They require
more time to rise than large loaves, as, being small,
heat penetrates them almost at once, and thus there is
very little rising in the oven.</p>

<p>Bake in a quick oven twenty minutes.<a name="Page_215" id="Page_215"></a></p>


<p>PARKER-HOUSE ROLLS.</p>

<p>Two quarts of flour; one pint of milk; butter the size
of an egg; one tablespoonful of sugar; one teacupful of
good yeast; one teaspoonful of salt.</p>

<p>Boil the milk, and add the butter, salt, and sugar.
Sift the flour into a deep bowl, and, when the milk is
merely blood-warm, stir together with enough of the flour
to form a batter or sponge. Do this at nine or ten in the
evening, and set in a cool place, from 50&deg; to 60&deg;. Next
morning about nine mix in the remainder of the flour; turn
on to the molding-board; and knead for twenty minutes,
using as little flour as possible. Return to the bowl, and set
in cool place again till about four in the afternoon. Knead
again for fifteen minutes; roll out, and cut into rounds,
treating them as in plain rolls. Let them rise one hour,
and bake twenty minutes. One kneading makes a good
breakfast roll; but, to secure the peculiar delicacy of a
&quot;Parker-House,&quot; two are essential, and they are generally
baked as a folded or pocket roll. If baked round, make
the dough into a long roll on the board; cut off small
pieces, and make into round balls with the hand, setting
them well apart in the pan.</p>


<p>SODA AND CREAM OF TARTAR BISCUIT.</p>

<p>One quart of flour; one even teaspoonful of salt; one
teaspoonful of soda, and two of cream of tartar; a piece
of lard or butter the size of an egg; and a large cup of
milk or water.</p>

<p>Mix the soda, cream of tartar, and salt with the flour,
having first mashed them fine, and sift all together twice.
Rub the shortening in with the hands till perfectly fine.
Add the milk; mix and roll out as quickly as possible;
<a name="Page_216" id="Page_216"></a>cut in rounds, and bake in a quick oven. If properly
made, they are light as puffs; but their success depends
upon thorough and rapid mixing and baking.</p>


<p>BAKING-POWDER BISCUIT.</p>

<p>Make as above, using two heaping teaspoonfuls of
baking powder, instead of the soda and cream of tartar.</p>


<p>BEATEN BISCUIT.</p>

<p>Three pints of sifted flour; one cup of lard; one teaspoonful
of salt. Rub the lard and flour well together,
and make into a very stiff dough with about a cup of milk
or water: a little more may be necessary. Beat the dough
with a rolling-pin for half an hour, or run through the
little machine that comes for the purpose. Make into
small biscuit, prick several times, and bake till brown.</p>


<p>WAFERS.</p>

<p>One pint of sifted flour; a piece of butter the size of a
walnut; half a teaspoonful of salt.</p>

<p>Rub butter and flour together, and make into dough
with half a cup of warm milk. Beat half an hour with
the rolling-pin. Then take a bit of it no larger than a
nut, and roll to the size of a saucer. They can not be too
thin. Flour the pans lightly, and bake in a quick oven
from five to ten minutes.</p>


<p>WAFFLES.</p>

<p>One pint of flour; one teaspoonful of baking powder;
half a teaspoonful of salt; three eggs; butter the size of
an egg; and one and a quarter cups of milk.</p>

<p>Sift salt and baking powder with the flour; rub in the
<a name="Page_217" id="Page_217"></a>butter. Mix and add the beaten yolks and milk, and last
stir in the whites which have been beaten to a stiff froth.
Bake at once in well-greased waffle-irons. By using two
cups of milk, the mixture is right for pancakes. If sour
milk is used, substitute soda for the baking powder. Sour
cream makes delicious waffles.</p>


<p>RICE OR HOMINY WAFFLES.</p>

<p>One pint of warm boiled rice or hominy; one cup of
sweet or sour milk; butter the size of a walnut; three
eggs; one teaspoonful of salt and one of soda sifted with
one pint of flour.</p>

<p>Stir rice and milk together; add the beaten yolks; then
the flour, and last the whites beaten stiff. By adding a
small cup more of milk, rice pancakes can be made.
Boiled oatmeal or wheaten grits may be substituted for
the rice.</p>


<p>BREAKFAST PUFFS OR POP-OVERS.</p>

<p>One pint of flour, one pint of milk, and one egg. Stir
the milk into the flour; beat the egg very light, and add it,
stirring it well in. Meantime have a set of gem-pans
well buttered, heating in the oven. Put in the dough (the
material is enough for a dozen puffs), and bake for half an
hour in a <i>very hot oven</i>. This is one of the simplest but
most delicate breakfast cakes made. Ignorant cooks generally
spoil several batches by persisting in putting in
baking powder or soda, as they can not believe that the
puffs will rise without.</p>


<p>SHORT-CAKE.</p>

<p>One quart of flour; one teaspoonful of salt and two of
baking powder sifted with the flour; one cup of butter, or
<a name="Page_218" id="Page_218"></a>half lard and half butter; one large cup of hot milk. Rub
the butter into the flour. Add the milk, and roll out the
dough, cutting in small square cakes and baking to a light
brown.</p>

<p>For a strawberry or peach short-cake have three tin
pie-plates buttered; roll the dough to fit them, and bake
quickly. Fill either, when done, with a quart of strawberries
or raspberries mashed with a cup of sugar, or
with peaches cut fine and sugared, and served hot.</p>


<p>CORN BREAD.</p>

<p>Two cups of corn meal; one cup of flour; one teaspoonful
of soda and one of salt; one heaping tablespoonful
of butter; a teacup full of sugar; three eggs; two cups of
sour milk, the more creamy the better. If sweet milk is
used, substitute baking powder for soda.</p>

<p>Sift meal, flour, soda, and salt together; beat the yolks
of the eggs with the sugar; add the milk, and stir into the
meal; melt the butter, and stir in, beating hard for five
minutes. Beat the whites stiff, and stir in, and bake at
once either in one large, round loaf, or in tin pie-plates.
The loaf will need half an hour or a little more; the pie-plates,
not over twenty minutes.</p>

<p>This can be baked as muffins, or, by adding another cup
of milk, becomes a pancake mixture.</p>


<p>HOE-CAKE.</p>

<p>One quart of corn meal; one teaspoon full of salt; one
tablespoonful of melted lard; one large cup of boiling
water. Melt the lard in the water. Mix the salt with the
meal, and pour on the water, stirring it into a dough.
When cool, make either into one large oval cake or two
<a name="Page_219" id="Page_219"></a>smaller ones, and bake in the oven to a bright brown,
which will take about half an hour; or make in small
cakes, and bake slowly on a griddle, browning well on
each side. Genuine hoe-cake is baked before an open fire
on a board.</p>


<p>BUCKWHEAT CAKES.</p>

<p>Two cups of buckwheat flour; one of wheat flour; one
of corn meal; half a cup of yeast; one teaspoonful of
salt; one quart of boiling water. Mix the corn meal and
salt, and pour on the boiling water very slowly, that the
meal may swell. As soon as merely warm, stir in the
sifted flour and yeast. All buckwheat may be used, instead
of part wheat flour. Beat well, cover, and put in a
cool place,&mdash;about 60&deg;. In the morning stir well, and
add half a teaspoonful of soda dissolved in a little warm
water. Grease the griddle with a bit of salt pork on a
fork, or a <i>very little</i> drippings rubbed over it evenly, but
never have it floating with fat, as many cooks do. Drop
in large spoonfuls, and bake and serve <i>few at a time</i>, or
they will become heavy and unfit to eat. If a cupful of
the batter is saved, no yeast need be used for the next
baking, and in cold weather this can be done for a month.</p>


<p>HUCKLEBERRY CAKE.</p>

<p>One quart of flour; one teaspoonful of salt and two of
baking powder sifted with the flour; one pint of huckleberries;
half a cup of butter; two eggs; two cups of
sweet milk; two cups of sugar.</p>

<p>Cream the butter, and add the sugar and yolks of eggs;
stir in the milk, and add the flour slowly; then beating
the whites of the eggs stiff, and adding them. Have the
huckleberries picked over, washed, dried, and well dusted
<a name="Page_220" id="Page_220"></a>with flour. Stir them in last of all; fill the pans three-quarters
full, and bake in a moderate oven for about half
an hour.</p>


<p>APPLE CAKE.</p>

<p>Make as above; but, instead of huckleberries, use one
pint of sour, tender apples, cut in thin slices. It is a delicious
breakfast or tea cake.</p>


<p>BROWN-BREAD BREWIS.</p>

<p>Dry all bits of crust or bread in the oven, browning
them nicely. To a pint of these, allow one quart of milk,
half a cup of butter, and a teaspoonful of salt. Boil the
milk; add the butter and salt, and then the browned
bread, and simmer slowly for fifteen minutes, or until perfectly
soft. It is very nice. Bits of white bread or sea
biscuit can be used in the same way.</p>


<p>CRISPED CRACKERS.</p>

<p>Split large soft crackers, what is called the &quot;Boston
cracker&quot; being best; butter them well as for eating; lay
the buttered halves in baking-pans, and brown in a quick
oven. Good at any meal.</p>


<p>SOUR BREAD.</p>

<p>If, by any mishap, bread has soured a little, make into
water toast or brewis, adding a teaspoonful of soda to the
water or milk.</p>


<p>TO USE DRY BREAD.</p>

<p>Brown in the oven every scrap that is left, seeing that
it does not scorch. Roll while hot and crisp, and sift,
using the fine crumbs for croquettes, &amp;c., and the coarser
ones for puddings and pancakes. Keep dry in glass jars;
or tin cans will answer.<a name="Page_221" id="Page_221"></a></p>


<p>BREAD PANCAKES.</p>

<p>One cup of coarse crumbs, soaked over-night in a quart
of warm milk, or milk and water. In the morning mash
fine, and run through a sieve. Add three eggs well beaten,
half a cup of flour, a large spoonful of sugar, a teaspoonful
of salt, and, if liked, a little nutmeg. If the bread was
in the least sour, add a teaspoonful of soda dissolved in a
little warm water. Bake like pancakes, but more slowly.</p>


<p>TO FRESHEN STALE BREAD OR ROLLS.</p>

<p>Wrap in a cloth, and steam for ten or fifteen minutes in
a steamer. Then dry in the oven. Rolls or biscuits may
have the top crust wet with a little melted butter, and then
brown a minute after steaming.</p>

<h2><a name="CAKE" id="CAKE" />CAKE.</h2>


<p>CAKE-MAKING.</p>

<p>In all cake-making, see that every thing is ready to
your hand,&mdash;pans buttered, or papered if necessary;
flour sifted; all spices and other materials on your working-table;
and the fire in good order.</p>

<p>No matter how plain the cake, there is a certain order
in mixing, which, if followed, produces the best result
from the materials used; and this order is easily reduced
to rules.</p>

<p>First, always cream the butter; that is, stir it till light
and creamy. If very cold, heat the bowl a little, but
never enough to melt, only to soften the butter.<a name="Page_222" id="Page_222"></a>
Second, add the sugar to the butter, and mix thoroughly.</p>

<p>Third, if eggs are used, beat yolks and whites separately
for a delicate cake; add yolks to sugar and butter,
and beat together a minute. For a plain cake, beat yolks
and whites together (a Dover egg-beater doing this better
than any thing else can), and add to butter and sugar.</p>

<p>Fourth, if milk is used, add this.</p>

<p>Fifth, stir in the measure of flour little by little, and
beat smooth.</p>

<p>Flavoring may be added at any time. If dry spices
are used, mix them with the sugar. Always sift baking
powder with the flour. If soda and cream of tartar are
used, sift the cream of tartar with the flour, and dissolve
the soda in a little milk or warm water. For very delicate
cakes, powdered sugar is best. For gingerbreads and
small cakes or cookies, light brown answers.</p>

<p>Where fruit cake is to be made, raisins should be stoned
and chopped, and currants washed and dried, the day
beforehand. A cup of currants being a nice and inexpensive
addition to buns or any plain cake, it is well to
prepare several pounds at once, drying thoroughly, and
keeping in glass jars. Being the very dirtiest article
known to the storeroom, currants require at least three
washings in warm water, rubbing them well in the hands.
Then spread them out on a towel, and proceed to pick out
all the sticks, grit, small stones, and legs and wings to be
found; then put the fruit into a slow oven, and dry it
carefully, that none may scorch.</p>

<p>In baking, a moderate oven is one in which a teaspoonful
of flour will brown while you count thirty; a quick
one, where but twelve can be counted.</p>

<p>The &quot;cup&quot; used in all these receipts is the ordinary
<a name="Page_223" id="Page_223"></a>kitchen cup, holding half a pint. The measures of flour
are, in all cases, of <i>sifted flour</i>, which can be sifted by the
quantity, and kept in a wooden pail. &quot;Prepared flour&quot;
is especially nice for doughnuts and plain cakes. No
great variety of receipts is given, as every family is sure
to have one enthusiastic cake-maker who gleans from all
sources; and this book aims to give fuller space to substantials
than to sweets. Half the energy spent by many
housekeepers upon cake would insure the perfect bread,
which, nine times out of ten, is not found upon their
tables, and success in which they count an impossibility.
If cake is to be made, however, let it be done in the
most perfect way; seeing only that bread is first irreproachable.</p>


<p>SPONGE CAKE.</p>

<p>One pound of the finest granulated, or of powdered,
sugar; half a pound of sifted flour; ten eggs; grated
rind of two lemons, and the juice of one; and a saltspoonful
of salt.</p>

<p>Break the eggs, yolks and whites separately, and beat
the yolks to a creamy froth. Beat the whites till they
can be turned upside down without spilling. Put yolks
and whites together, and beat till blended; then add the
sugar slowly; then the lemon rind and juice and the
salt, and last the flour. Whisk together as lightly and
quickly as possible. Turn into either three buttered
bread-pans of the size given on p. 201, or bake in a large
loaf, as preferred. Fill the pans two-thirds full, and,
when in the oven, do not open it for ten minutes. Bake
about half an hour, and test by running a clean broom-straw
into the loaf. If it comes out dry, they are done.
Turn out, and cool on a sieve, or on the pans turned upside
down.<a name="Page_224" id="Page_224"></a></p>


<p>ROLLED JELLY CAKE.</p>

<p>Three eggs, yolks and whites beaten separately; one
heaped cup of sugar; one scant cup of flour in which a
teaspoonful of baking powder and a pinch of salt have
been sifted; quarter of a cup of boiling water.</p>

<p>Mix as in sponge cake; add the water last, and bake in
a large roasting-pan, spreading the batter as thinly as possible.
It will bake in ten minutes. When done, and while
still hot, spread with any acid jelly, and roll carefully from
one side. This cake is nice for lining Charlotte-Russe
molds also. For that purpose the water may be omitted,
its only use being to make the cake roll more easily.</p>


<p>CUP CAKE.</p>

<p>One cup of butter; two cups of sugar; four eggs, yolks
and whites beaten separately; one cup of milk; three and
a half cups of flour; a grated nutmeg, or a teaspoonful
of vanilla or lemon; and a heaping teaspoonful of baking
powder.</p>

<p>Cream the butter; add the sugar, and then the yolks;
then the milk and the whites, and last the flour, in which
the baking powder has been sifted. Bake half an hour,
either in two brick loaves or one large one. It is nice,
also, baked in little tins. Half may be flavored with essence,
and the other half with a teaspoonful of mixed
spice,&mdash;half cinnamon, and the rest mace and allspice.
By using a heaping tablespoonful of yellow ginger, this
becomes a delicious sugar gingerbread, or, with mixed
spices and ginger, a spice gingerbread.</p>

<p>This cake with the variations upon it makes up page
after page in the large cook-books. Use but half a cup
of butter, and you have a plain <i>Cup Cake</i>. Add a cup of
<a name="Page_225" id="Page_225"></a>currants and one of chopped raisins, and it is plain <i>Fruit
Cake</i>, needing to bake one hour. Bake on Washington-pie
tins, and you have the foundation for <i>Cream</i> and <i>Jelly
Cakes</i>. A little experience, and then invention, will show
you how varied are the combinations, and how one page
in your cook-book can do duty for twenty.</p>


<p>POUND CAKE.</p>

<p>One pound of sugar; one pound of flour; three-quarters
of a pound of butter; nine eggs; one teaspoonful of
baking powder, and one of lemon extract; one nutmeg
grated.</p>

<p>Cream the butter, and add half the flour, sifting the
baking powder with the other half. Beat the yolks to a
creamy foam, and add; and then the sugar, beating hard.
Have the whites a stiff froth, and stir in, adding flavoring
and remainder of flour. Bake in one large loaf for one
hour, letting the oven be moderate. Frost, if liked.</p>


<p>FRUIT CAKE.</p>

<p>One pound of butter; one pound of sugar; one pound
and a quarter of sifted flour; ten eggs; two nutmegs
grated; a tablespoonful each of ground cloves, cinnamon,
and allspice; a teaspoonful of soda; a cup of brandy or
wine, and one of dark molasses; one pound of citron;
two pounds of stoned and chopped raisins, and two of currants
washed and dried.</p>

<p>Dredge the prepared fruit with enough of the flour to
coat it thoroughly. To have the cake very dark and rich
looking, brown the flour a little, taking great care not to
scorch it. Cream the butter, and add the sugar, in which
the spices have been mixed; then the beaten yolks of
<a name="Page_226" id="Page_226"></a>eggs; then the whites beaten to a stiff froth, and the
flour. Dissolve the soda in a very little warm water, and
add. Now stir in the fruit. Have either one large, round
pan, or two smaller ones. Put at least three thicknesses
of buttered letter-paper on the sides and bottom; turn
in the mixture, and bake for three hours in a moderate
oven. Cover with thick paper if there is the least danger
of scorching. This will keep, if well frosted, for two
years.</p>


<p>DOVER CAKE.</p>

<p>One pound of flour; one pound of sugar; half a pound
of butter; one teacup of milk; six eggs; one teaspoonful
of baking powder; one grated nutmeg.</p>

<p>Cream the butter; add first sugar, then beaten yolks of
eggs and milk, then whites of eggs beaten to a stiff froth,
and last the flour. Bake forty-five minutes in a large
dripping-pan, sifting fine sugar over the top, and cut in
small squares; or it may be baked in one round loaf, and
frosted on the bottom, or in small tins. Half a pound of
citron cut fine is often added.</p>


<p>WHITE OR SILVER CAKE.</p>

<p>Half a cup of butter; a heaping cupful of powdered
sugar; two cups of flour, with a teaspoonful of baking
powder sifted in; half a cup of milk; whites of six eggs;
one teaspoonful of almond extract.</p>

<p>Cream the butter, and add the flour, beating till it is a
smooth paste. Beat the whites to a stiff froth, and add
the sugar and essence. Now mix both quickly, and bake
in a sheet about an inch and a half thick. About half an
hour will be needed. Frost while hot, with one white of
egg, beaten ten minutes with a small cup of sifted pow<a name="Page_227" id="Page_227"></a>dered
sugar, and juice of half a lemon. This frosting
hardens very quickly. Before it is quite hard, divide it
into oblong or square pieces, scoring at intervals with the
back of a large knife. The milk can be omitted if a
richer cake is wanted. It may also be baked in jelly-cake
tins; one small cocoanut grated, and mixed with one cup
of sugar, and spread between, and the whole frosted. Or
beat the white of an egg with one cup of sugar, and the
juice of one large or two small oranges, and spread between.
Either form is delicious.</p>


<p>GOLD CAKE.</p>

<p>One cup of sugar; half a cup of butter; two cups of
flour; yolks of six eggs; grated rind and juice of a
lemon or orange; half a teaspoonful of soda, mixed with
the flour, and sifted twice.</p>

<p>Cream the butter; add the sugar, then the beaten
yolks and the flour, beating hard for several minutes.
Last, add the lemon or orange juice, and bake like silver
cake; frosting, if liked. If frosting is made for either or
both cakes, the extra yolks may be used in making this
one, eight being still nicer than six.</p>


<p>BREAD CAKE.</p>

<p>Two cups or a pint-bowlful of raised dough ready for
baking; one cup of butter; two cups of sugar; one teaspoonful
of ground cinnamon, or half a nutmeg grated;
three eggs; one teaspoonful of soda in quarter of a cup
of warm water, and half a cup of flour.</p>

<p>Cream the butter, and add the sugar. Then put in the
bread dough, and work together till well mixed. The
hand is best for this, though it can be done with a wooden
<a name="Page_228" id="Page_228"></a>spoon. Add the eggs, then the flour, and last the soda.
Let it stand in a warm place for one hour, and bake in a
moderate oven forty-five minutes, testing with a broom-straw.
A pound of stoned and chopped raisins is a nice
addition. Omitting them, and adding flour enough to roll
out, makes an excellent raised doughnut or bun. Let it
rise two hours; then cut in shapes, and fry in boiling lard.
Or, for buns, bake in a quick oven, and, a minute before
taking out, brush the top with a spoonful of sugar and
milk mixed together.</p>


<p>PLAIN BUNS.</p>

<p>One pint-bowlful of dough; one cup of sugar; butter
the size of an egg; one teaspoonful of cinnamon.</p>

<p>Boll the dough thin. Spread the butter upon it. Mix
sugar and cinnamon together, and sprinkle on it. Now
turn over the edges of the dough carefully to keep the
sugar in, and press and work gently for a few minutes,
that it may not break through. Knead till thoroughly
mixed. Roll out; cut like biscuit, and let them rise an
hour, baking in a quick oven.</p>

<p>The same rule can be used for raised doughnuts.</p>


<p>DOUGHNUTS.</p>

<p>First put on the lard, and let it be heating gradually.
To test it when hot, drop in a bit of bread; if it browns
as you count twenty, it is right. Never let it boil furiously,
or scorch. This is the rule for all frying, whether
fritters, croquettes, or cakes.</p>

<p>One quart of flour into which has been sifted a teaspoonful
of salt, and one of soda if sour milk is used, or two
of baking powder if sweet milk. If cream can be had,
<a name="Page_229" id="Page_229"></a>use part cream, allowing one large cup of milk, or cream
and milk. One heaping cup of fine brown sugar; one
teaspoonful of ground cinnamon, and half a one of
mace or nutmeg; use one spoonful of butter, if you
have no cream, stirring it into the sugar. Add two or
three beaten eggs; mixing all as in general directions for
cake. They can be made without eggs. Roll out; cut in
shapes, and fry brown, taking them out with a fork into a
sieve set over a pan that all fat may drain off.</p>

<p>Cut thin, and baked brown in a quick oven, these make
a good plain cooky.</p>


<p>GINGER SNAPS.</p>

<p>One cup of butter and lard or dripping mixed, or
dripping alone can be used; one cup of molasses; one
cup of brown sugar; two teaspoonfuls of ginger, and one
each of clove, allspice, and mace; one teaspoonful of salt,
and one of soda dissolved in half a cup of hot water; one
egg.</p>

<p>Stir together the shortening, sugar, molasses, and spice.
Add the soda, and then sifted flour enough to make a
dough,&mdash;about three pints. Turn on to the board, and
knead well. Take about quarter of it, and roll out thin as
a knife-blade. Bake in a quick oven. They will bake in
five minutes, and will keep for months. By using only
four cups of flour, this can be baked in a loaf as spiced
gingerbread; or it can be rolled half an inch thick, and
baked as a cooky. In this, as in all cakes, experience
will teach you many variations.</p>


<p>PLAIN GINGERBREAD.</p>

<p>Two cups of molasses; one of sour milk; half a cup
of lard or drippings; four cups of flour; two teaspoonfuls
<a name="Page_230" id="Page_230"></a>of ginger, and one of cinnamon; half a teaspoonful of
salt; one egg, and a teaspoonful of soda.</p>

<p>Mix molasses and shortening; add the spice and egg,
then the milk, and last the flour, with soda sifted in it.
Bake at once in a sheet about an inch thick for half an
hour. Try with a broom-straw. Good hot for lunch with
chocolate. A plain cooky is made by adding flour enough
to roll out. The egg may be omitted.</p>


<p>JUMBLES.</p>

<p>The richest jumbles are made from either the rule for
Pound or Dover Cake, with flour enough added to roll out.
The Cup-Cake rule makes good but plainer ones. Make
rings, either by cutting in long strips and joining the ends,
or by using a large and small cutter. Sift sugar over the
top, and bake a delicate brown. By adding a large spoonful
of yellow ginger, any of these rules become hard
sugar-gingerbread, and all will keep for a long time.</p>


<p>DROP CAKES.</p>

<p>Any of the rules last mentioned become drop cakes by
buttering muffin-tins or tin sheets, and dropping a teaspoonful
of these mixtures into them. If on sheets, let
them be two inches apart. Sift sugar over the top, and
bake in a quick oven. They are done as soon as brown.</p>


<p>CREAM CAKES.</p>

<p>One pint of boiling water in a saucepan. Melt in it a
piece of butter the size of an egg. Add half a teaspoonful
of salt. While still boiling, stir in one large cup of
flour, and cook for three minutes. Take from the fire;
cool ten minutes; then break in, one by one, six eggs,
<a name="Page_231" id="Page_231"></a>and beat till smooth. Have muffin-pans buttered, or
large baking-sheets. Drop a spoonful of the mixture on
them, allowing room to spread, and bake half an hour in
a quick oven. Cool on a sieve, and, when cool, fill with a
cream made as below.</p>

<p>FILLING FOR CREAM CAKES.</p>

<p>One pint of milk, one cup of sugar, two eggs, half a
cup of flour, and a piece of butter the size of a walnut.</p>

<p>Mix the sugar and flour, add the beaten eggs, and beat
all till smooth. Stir into the boiling milk with a teaspoonful
of salt, and boil for fifteen minutes. When cold,
add a teaspoonful of vanilla or lemon. Make a slit in
each cake, and fill with the cream. Corn-starch may be
used instead of flour. This makes a very nice filling for
plain cup cake baked on jelly-cake tins.</p>


<p>MERINGUES, OR KISSES.</p>

<p>Whites of three eggs beaten to a stiff froth; quarter of
a pound of sifted powdered sugar; a few drops of vanilla.</p>

<p>Add the sugar to the whites. Have ready a hard-wood
board which fits the oven. Wet the top well with boiling
water, and cover it with sheets of letter-paper. Drop the
meringue mixture on this in large spoonfuls, and set in a
<i>very slow</i> oven. The secret of a good meringue is to <i>dry</i>,
not bake; and they should be in the oven at least half an
hour. Take them out when dry. Slip a thin, sharp knife
under each one, and put two together; or scoop out the
soft part very carefully, and fill with a little jelly or with
whipped cream.</p>

<h2><a name="PASTRY_AND_PIES" id="PASTRY_AND_PIES" /><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232"></a>PASTRY AND PIES.</h2>


<p>In the first place, don't make either, except very semi-occasionally.
Pastry, even when good, is so indigestible
that children should never have it, and their elders but
seldom. A nice short-cake made as on p. 209, and filled
with stewed fruit, or with fresh berries mashed and sweetened,
is quite as agreeable to eat, and far more wholesome.
But, as people <i>will</i> both make and eat pie-crust, the best
rules known are given.</p>

<p>Butter, being more wholesome than lard, should always
be used if it can be afforded. A mixture of lard and
butter is next best. Clarified dripping makes a good
crust for meat pies, and cream can also be used. For
dumplings nothing can be better than a light biscuit-crust,
made as on p. 208. It is also good for meat pies.</p>


<p>PLAIN PIE-CRUST.</p>

<p>One quart of flour; one even teacup of lard, and one
of butter; one teacup of ice-water or very cold water;
and a teaspooonful of salt.</p>

<p>Rub the lard and salt into the flour till it is dry and
crumbly. Add the ice-water, and work to a smooth
dough. Wash the butter, and have it cold and firm as
possible. Divide it in three parts. Roll out the paste,
and dot it all over with bits from one part of the butter.
Sprinkle with flour, and roll up. Roll out, and repeat till
the butter is gone. If the crust can now stand on the ice
for half an hour, it will be nicer and more flaky. This
amount will make three good-sized pies. Enough for the
<a name="Page_233" id="Page_233"></a>bottom crusts can be taken off after one rolling in of butter,
thus making the top crust richer. Lard alone will
make a tender, but not a flaky, paste.</p>


<p>PUFF PASTE.</p>

<p>One pound of flour; three-quarters of a pound of butter;
one teacupful of ice-water; one teaspoonful of salt,
and one of sugar; yolk of one egg.</p>

<p>Wash the butter; divide into three parts, reserving a
bit the size of an egg; and put it on the ice for an hour.
Rub the bit of butter, the salt, and sugar, into the flour,
and stir in the ice-water and egg beaten together. Make
into a dough, and knead on the molding-board till glossy
and firm: at least ten minutes will be required. Roll out
into a sheet ten or twelve inches square. Cut a cake of
the ice-cold butter in thin slices, or flatten it very thin
with the rolling-pin. Lay it on the paste, sprinkle with
flour, and fold over the edges. Press it in somewhat with
the rolling-pin, and roll out again. Always roll <i>from</i> you.
Do this again and again till the butter is all used, rolling
up the paste after the last cake is in, and then putting it
on the ice for an hour or more. Have filling all ready,
and let the paste be as nearly ice-cold as possible when
it goes into the oven. There are much more elaborate
rules; but this insures handsome paste. Make a plainer
one for the bottom crusts. Cover puff paste with a damp
cloth, and it may be kept on the ice a day or two before
baking.</p>


<p>PATTIES FROM PUFF PASTE.</p>

<p>Roll the paste about a third of an inch thick, and cut
out with a round or oval cutter about two inches in diameter.
Take a cutter half an inch smaller, and press it into
<a name="Page_234" id="Page_234"></a>the piece already cut out, so as to sink half-way through
the crust: this to mark out the top piece. Lay on tins,
and bake to a delicate brown. They should treble in
thickness by rising, and require from twenty minutes to
half an hour to bake. When done, the marked-out top
can easily be removed. Take out the soft inside, and fill
with sweetmeats for dessert, or with minced chicken or
oysters prepared as on p. 140.</p>


<p>GRANDMOTHER'S APPLE PIE.</p>

<p>Line a deep pie-plate with plain paste. Pare sour
apples,&mdash;greenings are best; quarter, and cut in thin
slices. Allow one cup of sugar, and quarter of a grated
nutmeg mixed with it. Fill the pie-plate heaping full of
the sliced apple, sprinkling the sugar between the layers.
It will require not less than six good-sized apples. Wet
the edges of the pie with cold water; lay on the cover, and
press down securely, that no juice may escape. Bake
three-quarters of an hour, or a little less if the apples are
very tender. No pie in which the apples are stewed
beforehand can compare with this in flavor. If they are
used, stew till tender, and strain. Sweeten and flavor to
taste. Fill the pies, and bake half an hour.</p>


<p>DRIED-APPLE PIES.</p>

<p>Wash one pint of dried apples, and put in a porcelain
kettle with two quarts of warm water. Let them stand
all night. In the morning put on the fire, and stew slowly
for an hour. Then add one pint of sugar, a teaspoonful
of dried lemon or orange rind, or half a fresh lemon
sliced, and half a teaspoonful of cinnamon. Stew half
an hour longer, and then use for filling the pies. The
<a name="Page_235" id="Page_235"></a>apple can be strained if preferred, and a teaspoonful of
butter added. This quantity will make two pies. Dried
peaches are treated in the same way.</p>


<p>LEMON PIES.</p>

<p>Three lemons, juice of all and the grated rind of two;
two cups of sugar; three cups of boiling water; three
tablespoonfuls of corn-starch dissolved in a little cold
water; three eggs; a piece of butter the size of an egg.</p>

<p>Pour the boiling water on the dissolved corn-starch, and
boil for five minutes. Add the sugar and butter, the yolks
of the eggs beaten to a froth, and last the lemon juice and
rind. Line the plates with crust, putting a narrow rim of
it around each one. Pour in the filling, and bake half an
hour. Beat the whites to a stiff froth; add half a teacup
of powdered sugar and ten drops of lemon extract, and,
when the pie is baked, spread this on. The heat will cook
it sufficiently, but it can be browned a moment in the oven.
If to be kept a day, do not make the frosting till just before
using. The whites will keep in a cold place. Orange
pie can be made in the same way.</p>


<p>SWEET-POTATO PIE OR PUDDING.</p>

<p>One pound of hot, boiled sweet potato rubbed through
a sieve; one cup of butter; one heaping cup of sugar;
half a grated nutmeg; one glass of brandy; a pinch of
salt; six eggs.</p>

<p>Add the sugar, spice, and butter to the hot potato.
Beat whites and yolks separately, and add, and last the
brandy. Line deep plates with nice paste, making a rim of
puff paste. Fill with the mixture, and bake till the crust is
done,&mdash;about half an hour. Wickedly rich, but very deli<a name="Page_236" id="Page_236"></a>cious.
Irish potatoes can be treated in the same way, and
are more delicate.</p>


<p>SQUASH OR PUMPKIN PIE.</p>

<p>Prepare and steam as in directions on p. 194. Strain
through a sieve. To a quart of the strained squash add
one quart of new milk, with a spoonful or two of cream
if possible; one heaping cup of sugar into which has
been stirred a teaspoonful of salt, a heaping one of ginger,
and half a one of cinnamon. Mix this with the
squash, and add from two to four well-beaten eggs. Bake
in deep plates lined with plain pie-crust. They are done
when a knife-blade on being run into the middle comes
out clean. About forty minutes will be enough. For
pumpkin pie half a cup of molasses may be added, and
the eggs can be omitted, substituting half a cup of flour
mixed with the sugar and spice before stirring in. A teaspoonful
of butter can also be added.</p>


<p>CHERRY AND BERRY PIES.</p>

<p>Have a very deep plate, and either no under crust save
a rim, or a very thin one. Allow a cup of sugar to a
quart of fruit, but no spices. Stone cherries. Prick the
upper crust half a dozen times with a fork to let out the
steam.</p>

<p>For rhubarb or pie-plant pies, peel the stalks; cut them
in little bits, and fill the pie. Bake with an upper crust.</p>


<p>CUSTARD PIE.</p>

<p>Line and rim deep plates with pastry, a thin custard
pie being very poor. Beat together a teacupful of sugar,
four eggs, and a pinch of salt, and mix slowly with one
<a name="Page_237" id="Page_237"></a>quart of milk. Fill the plate up to the pastry rim <i>after
it is in the oven</i>, and bake till the custard is firm, trying, as
for squash pies, with a knife-blade.</p>


<p>MINCE-MEAT FOR PIES.</p>

<p>Two pounds of cold roast or boiled beef, or a small
beef-tongue, boiled the day beforehand, cooled and
chopped; one pound of beef-suet, freed from all strings,
and chopped fine as powder; two pounds of raisins
stoned and chopped; one pound of currants washed and
dried; six pounds of chopped apples; half a pound of
citron cut in slips; two pounds of brown sugar; one pint
of molasses; one quart of boiled cider; one pint of wine
or brandy, or a pint of any nice sirup from sweet pickles
may be substituted; two heaping tablespoonfuls of salt;
one teaspoonful of pepper; three tablespoonfuls of ground
cinnamon; two of allspice; one of clove; one of mace;
three grated nutmegs; grated rind and juice of three
lemons; a cupful of chopped, candied orange or lemon
peel.</p>

<p>Mix spices and salt with sugar, and stir into the meat
and suet. Add the apples, and then the cider and other
wetting, stirring very thoroughly. Lastly, mix in the
fruit. Fill and bake as in apple pies. This mince-meat
will keep two months easily. If it ferments at all, put
over the fire in a porcelain-lined kettle, and boil half an
hour. Taste, and judge for yourselves whether more or
less spice is needed. Butter can be used instead of suet,
and proportions varied to taste.</p>


<p>RAMMEKINS, OR CHEESE STRAWS.</p>

<p>One pound of puff paste; one cup of good grated
<a name="Page_238" id="Page_238"></a>cheese. Roll the paste half an inch thick; sprinkle on
half the cheese; press in lightly with the rolling-pin; roll
up, and roll out again, using the other half of the cheese.
Fold, and roll about a third of an inch thick. Cut in long,
narrow strips, four or five inches long and half an inch
wide, and bake in a quick oven to a delicate brown. Excellent
with chocolate at lunch, or for dessert with fruit.</p>

<h2><a name="PUDDINGS_BOILED_AND_BAKED" id="PUDDINGS_BOILED_AND_BAKED" />PUDDINGS BOILED AND BAKED.</h2>

<p>For boiled puddings a regular pudding-boiler holding
from three pints to two quarts is best, a tin pail with a
very tight-fitting cover answering instead, though not as
good. For large dumplings a thick pudding-cloth&mdash;the
best being of Canton flannel, used with the nap-side out&mdash;should
be dipped in hot water, and wrung out, dredged
evenly and thickly with flour, and laid over a large bowl.
From half to three-quarters of a yard square is a good
size. In filling this, pile the fruit or berries on the rolled-out
crust which has been laid in the middle of the cloth,
and gather the edges of the paste evenly over it. Then
gather the cloth up, leaving room for the dumpling to
swell, and tying very tightly. In turning out, lift to a
dish; press all the water from the ends of the cloth; untie
and turn away from the pudding, and lay a hot dish upon
it, turning over the pudding into it, and serving at once,
as it darkens or falls by standing.</p>

<p>In using a boiler, butter well, and fill only two-thirds
full that the mixture may have room to swell. Set it in
<a name="Page_239" id="Page_239"></a>boiling water, and see that it is kept at the same height,
about an inch from the top. Cover the outer kettle that
the steam may be kept in. Small dumplings, with a single
apple or peach in each, can be cooked in a steamer.
Puddings are not only much more wholesome, but less
expensive than pies.</p>


<p>APPLE DUMPLING.</p>

<p>Make a crust, as for biscuit, or a potato-crust as follows:
Three large potatoes, boiled and mashed while hot.
Add to them two cups of sifted flour and one teaspoonful
of salt, and mix thoroughly. Now chop or cut into
it one small cup of butter, and mix into a paste with
about a teacupful of cold water. Dredge the board thick
with flour, and roll out,&mdash;thick in the middle, and thin
at the edges. Fill, as directed, with apples pared and
quartered, eight or ten good-sized ones being enough for
this amount of crust. Boil for three hours. Turn out as
directed, and eat with butter and sirup or with a made
sauce. Peaches pared and halved, or canned ones drained
from the sirup, can be used. In this case, prepare the
sirup for sauce, as on p. 172. Blueberries are excellent
in the same way.</p>


<p>ENGLISH PLUM PUDDING, OR CHRISTMAS PUDDING.</p>

<p>One pound of raisins stoned and cut in two; one pound
of currants washed and dried; one pound of beef-suet
chopped very fine; one pound of bread-crumbs; one pound
of flour; half a pound of brown sugar; eight eggs; one
pint of sweet milk; one teaspoonful of salt; a tablespoonful
of cinnamon; two grated nutmegs; a glass each of
wine and brandy.</p>

<p><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240"></a>Prepare the fruit, and dredge thickly with flour. Soak
the bread in the milk; beat the eggs, and add. Stir in
the rest of the flour, the suet, and last the fruit. Boil six
hours either in a cloth or large mold. Half the amounts
given makes a good-sized pudding; but, as it will keep
three months, it might be boiled in two molds. Serve
with a rich sauce.</p>


<p>ANY-DAY PLUM PUDDING.</p>

<p>One cup of sweet milk; one cup of molasses; one cup
each of raisins and currants; one cup of suet chopped
fine, or, instead, a small cup of butter; one teaspoonful of
salt, and one of soda, sifted with three cups of flour; one
teaspoonful each of cinnamon and allspice.</p>

<p>Mix milk, molasses, suet, and spice; add flour, and
then the fruit. Put in a buttered mold, and boil three
hours. Eat with hard or liquid sauce. A cupful each of
prunes and dates or figs can be substituted for the fruit,
and is very nice; and the same amount of dried apple,
measured after soaking and chopping, is also good. Or
the fruit can be omitted altogether, in which case it becomes
&quot;Troy Pudding.&quot;</p>


<p>BATTER PUDDING, BOILED OR BAKED.</p>

<p>Two cups of flour in which is sifted a heaping teaspoonful
of baking powder, two cups of sweet milk, four eggs,
one teaspoonful of salt. Stir the flour gradually into the
milk, and beat hard for five minutes. Beat yolks and
whites separately, and then add to batter. Have the
pudding-boiler buttered. Pour in the batter, and boil
steadily for two hours. It may also be baked an hour in
a buttered pudding-dish. Serve at once, when done, with
a liquid sauce.<a name="Page_241" id="Page_241"></a></p>


<p>SUNDERLAND PUDDINGS.</p>

<p>Are merely puffs or pop-overs eaten with sauce. See
p. 209.</p>


<p>BREAD PUDDING.</p>

<p>One cup of dried and rolled bread-crumbs, or one pint
of fresh ones; one quart of milk; two eggs; one cup of
sugar; half a teaspoonful of cinnamon; a little grated
nutmeg; a saltspoonful of salt.</p>

<p>Soak the crumbs in the milk for an hour or two; mix
the spice and salt with the sugar, and beat the eggs with
it, stirring them slowly into the milk. Butter a pudding-dish;
pour in the mixture; and bake half an hour, or till
done. Try with a knife-blade, as in general directions.
The whites may be kept out for a meringue, allowing half
a teacup of powdered sugar to them. By using fresh
bread-crumbs and four eggs, this becomes what is known
as &quot;Queen of Puddings.&quot; As soon as done, spread the
top with half a cup of any acid jelly, and cover with the
whites which have been beaten stiff, with a teacupful of
sugar. Brown slightly in the oven. Half a pound of
raisins may be added.</p>


<p>BREAD-AND-BUTTER PUDDING.</p>

<p>Fill a pudding-dish two-thirds full with very thin slices
of bread and butter. A cupful of currants or dried cherries
may be sprinkled between the slices. Make a custard
of two eggs beaten with a cup of sugar; add a quart of
milk, and pour over the bread. Cover with a plate, and
set on the back of the stove an hour; then bake from half
to three-quarters of an hour. Serve very hot, as it falls
when cool.<a name="Page_242" id="Page_242"></a></p>


<p>BREAD-AND-APPLE PUDDING.</p>

<p>Butter a deep pudding-dish, and put first a layer of
crumbs, then one of any good acid apple, sliced rather thin,
and so on till the dish is nearly full. Six or eight apples
and a quart of fresh crumbs will fill a two-quart dish.
Dissolve a cup of sugar and one teaspoonful of cinnamon
in one pint of boiling water, and pour into the dish. Let
the pudding stand half an hour to swell; then bake till
brown,&mdash;about three-quarters of an hour,&mdash;and eat with
liquid sauce. It can be made with slices of bread and
butter, instead of crumbs.</p>


<p>BIRD'S-NEST PUDDING.</p>

<p>Wash one teacupful of tapioca, and put it in one quart
of cold water to soak for several hours. Pare and core as
many good apples as will fit in a two-quart buttered pudding-dish.
When the tapioca is softened, add a cupful of
sugar, a pinch of salt, and half a teaspoonful of cinnamon,
and pour over the apples. Bake an hour, and eat
with or without sauce.</p>


<p>TAPIOCA PUDDING.</p>

<p>One quart of milk; one teacupful of tapioca; three eggs;
a cup of sugar; a teaspoonful of salt; a tablespoonful of
butter; a teaspoonful of lemon extract.</p>

<p>Wash the tapioca, and soak in the milk for two hours,
setting it on the back of the stove to swell. Beat eggs
and sugar together, reserving whites for a meringue if
liked; melt the butter, and add, and stir into the milk.
Bake half an hour. Sago pudding is made in the same
way.<a name="Page_243" id="Page_243"></a></p>


<p>TAPIOCA CREAM.</p>

<p>One teacupful of tapioca washed and soaked over-night
in one pint of warm water. Next morning add a quart
of milk and a teaspoonful of salt, and boil in a milk-boiler
for two hours. Just before taking it from the fire,
add a tablespoonful of butter, a teaspoonful of vanilla,
and three eggs beaten with a cup of sugar. The whites
may be made in a meringue. Pour into a glass dish which
has had warm water standing in it, to prevent cracking,
and eat cold. Rice or sago cream is made in the same
way.</p>


<p>PLAIN RICE PUDDING.</p>

<p>One cup of rice; three pints of milk; one heaping cup
of sugar; one teaspoonful of salt.</p>

<p>Wash the rice well. Butter a two-quart pudding-dish,
and stir rice, sugar, and salt together. Pour on the milk.
Grate nutmeg over it, and bake for three hours. Very
good.</p>


<p>MINUTE PUDDING.</p>

<p>One quart of milk; one pint of flour; two eggs; one
teaspoonful of salt.</p>

<p>Boil the milk in a double boiler. Beat the eggs, and
add the flour slowly, with enough of the milk to make it
smooth. Stir into the boiling milk, and cook it half an
hour. Eat with liquid sauce or sirup. It is often made
without eggs.</p>


<p>CORN-STARCH PUDDING.</p>

<p>One quart of milk; four tablespoonfuls of corn-starch;
one cup of sugar; three eggs; a teaspoonful each of
salt and vanilla.</p>

<p>Boil the milk; dissolve the corn-starch in a little cold
milk, and add. Cook five minutes, and add the eggs and
<a name="Page_244" id="Page_244"></a>flavoring beaten with the sugar. Turn into a buttered
dish, and bake fifteen minutes, covering then with a meringue
made of the whites, or cool in molds, in this case
using only the whites of the eggs. The yolks can be
made in a custard to pour around them. A cup of grated
cocoanut can be added, or two teaspoonfuls of chocolate
stirred smooth in a little boiling water.</p>


<p>GELATINE PUDDING.</p>

<p>Four eggs; one pint of milk; one cup of sugar; a saltspoonful
of salt; a teaspoonful of lemon or vanilla; a
third of a box of gelatine.</p>

<p>Soak the gelatine a few minutes in a little cold water,
and then dissolve it in three-quarters of a cup of boiling
water. Have ready a custard made from the milk and
yolks of the eggs. Beat the yolks and sugar together,
and stir into the boiling milk. When cold, add the gelatine
water and the whites of the eggs beaten very stiff.
Pour into molds. It is both pretty and good.</p>


<p>CABINET PUDDING.</p>

<p>One quart of milk; half a package of gelatine; a teaspoonful
each of salt and vanilla; a cup of sugar.</p>

<p>Boil the milk; soak the gelatine fifteen minutes in a
little cold water; dissolve in the boiling milk, and add the
sugar and salt. Now butter a Charlotte-Russe mold
thickly. Cut slips of citron into leaves or pretty shapes,
and stick on the mold. Fill it lightly with any light cake,
either plain or rich. Strain on the gelatine and milk, and
set in a cold place. Turn out before serving. Delicate
crackers may be used instead of cake.<a name="Page_245" id="Page_245"></a></p>


<p>CORN-MEAL OR INDIAN PUDDING.</p>

<p>One quart of milk; one cup of sifted corn meal; one
cup of molasses (not &quot;sirup&quot;); one teaspoonful of salt.</p>

<p>Stir meal, salt, and molasses together. Boil the milk,
and add slowly. Butter a pudding-dish, and pour in the
mixture; adding, after it is set in the oven, one cup of cold
milk poured over the top. Bake three hours in a moderate
oven.</p>

<p>BAKED CUSTARD.</p>

<p>One quart of milk; four eggs; one teacup of sugar;
half a teaspoonful of salt; nutmeg.</p>

<p>Boil the milk. Beat the eggs very light, and add the
sugar and salt. Pour on the milk very slowly, stirring
constantly. Bake in a pudding-dish or in cups. If in
cups, set them in a baking-pan, and half fill it with boiling
water. Grate nutmeg over each. The secret of a good
custard is in slow baking and the most careful watching.
Test often with a knife-blade, and do not bake an instant
after the blade comes out smooth and clean. To be eaten
cold. Six eggs are generally used; but four are plenty.</p>


<p>BOILED CUSTARD.</p>

<p>One quart of milk; three or four eggs; one cup of
sugar; one teaspoonful of vanilla; half a teaspoonful of
salt; one teaspoonful of corn-starch.</p>

<p>Boil the milk. Dissolve the corn-starch in a little cold
water, and boil in the milk five minutes. It prevents the
<a name="Page_246" id="Page_246"></a>custard from curdling, which otherwise it is very apt to do.
Beat the eggs and sugar well together, stir into the milk,
and add the salt and flavoring. Take at once from the
fire, and, when cool, pour either into a large glass dish,
covering with a meringue of the whites, or into small
glasses with a little jelly or jam at the bottom of each.
Or the whites can be used in making an apple-float, as
below, and the yolks for the custard.</p>

<p>For <i>Cocoanut Custard</i> add a cup of grated cocoanut;
for <i>Chocolate</i>, two tablespoonfuls of grated chocolate
dissolved in half a cup of boiling water.</p>


<p>TIPSY PUDDING.</p>

<p>Make a boiled custard as directed. Half fill a deep
dish with any light, stale cake. Add to a teacup of wine
a teacup of boiling water, and pour over it. Add the custard
just before serving.</p>


<p>APPLE FLOAT.</p>

<p>Six good, acid apples stewed and strained. When
cold, add a teacupful of sugar, half a teaspoonful of
vanilla, and the beaten whites of three or four eggs.
Serve at once.</p>


<p>BLANCMANGE.</p>

<p>One quart of milk; one cup of sugar; half a package
of gelatine; half a teaspoonful of salt; a teaspoonful of
any essence liked.</p>

<p>Soak the gelatine ten minutes in half a cup of cold
water. Boil the milk, and add gelatine and the other
ingredients. Strain into molds, and let it stand in a cold
place all night to harden. For chocolate blancmange add
two tablespoonfuls of scraped chocolate dissolved in a
little boiling water.<a name="Page_247" id="Page_247"></a></p>


<p>SPANISH CREAM.</p>

<p>Make a blancmange as on p. 238; but, just before
taking from the fire, add the yolks of four eggs, and then
strain. The whites can be used for meringues.</p>


<p>WHIPPED CREAM.</p>

<p>One pint of rich cream; one cup of sugar; one glass
of sherry or Madeira.</p>

<p>Mix all, and put on the ice an hour, as cream whips
much better when chilled. Using a whip-churn enables it
to be done in a few minutes; but a fork or egg-beater will
answer. Skim off all the froth as it rises, and lay on a
sieve to drain, returning the cream which drips away to
be whipped over again. Set on the ice a short time before
serving.</p>


<p>CHARLOTTE RUSSE.</p>

<p>Make a sponge cake as on p. 216, and line a Charlotte
mold with it, cutting a piece the size of the bottom, and
fitting the rest around the sides. Fill with cream whipped
as above, and let it stand on the ice to set a little. This
is the easiest form of Charlotte. It is improved by the
beaten whites of three eggs stirred into the cream. Flavor
with half a teaspoonful of vanilla if liked.</p>


<p>BAVARIAN CREAM.</p>

<p>Whip a pint of cream to a stiff froth. Boil a pint of
rich milk with a teacupful of sugar, and add a teaspoonful
of vanilla. Soak half a box of gelatine for an hour in
half a cup of warm water, and add to the milk. Add
the yolks of four eggs beaten smooth, and take from the
fire instantly.</p>

<p>When cold and just beginning to thicken, stir in the
<a name="Page_248" id="Page_248"></a>whipped cream. Put in molds, and set in a cold place.
This can be used also for filling Charlotte Russe. For
chocolate add chocolate as directed in rule for boiled custard;
for coffee, one teacup of clear, strong coffee.</p>


<p>STRAWBERRY CREAM.</p>

<p>Three pints of strawberries mashed fine. Strain the
juice, and add a heaping cup of sugar, and then gelatine
soaked as above, and dissolved in a teacup of boiling
water. Add the pint of whipped cream, and pour into
molds.</p>


<p>FRUIT CREAMS.</p>

<p>Half a pint of peach or pine-apple marmalade stirred
smooth with a teacupful of sweet cream. Add gelatine
dissolved as in rule for strawberry cream, and, when cold,
the pint of whipped cream. These creams are very delicious,
and not as expensive as rich pastry.</p>


<p>OMELETTE SOUFFL&Eacute;E.</p>

<p>Six whites and three yolks of eggs; three tablespoonfuls
of powdered sugar sifted; a few drops of lemon or
vanilla. Beat the yolks, flavoring, and sugar to a light
cream; beat the whites to the stiffest froth. Have the
yolks in a deep bowl. Turn the whites on to them, and
do not stir, but mix, by cutting down through the middle,
and gradually mixing white and yellow. Turn on to a
tin or earthen baking-dish with high sides, and bake in
a moderate oven from ten to fifteen minutes. It will rise
very high, and must be served the instant it is done, to
avoid its falling.<a name="Page_249" id="Page_249"></a></p>


<p>FRIED CREAM.</p>

<p>One pint of milk; half a cup of sugar; yolks of three
eggs; two tablespoonfuls of corn-starch and one of flour
mixed; half a teaspoonful of vanilla, and two inches of
stick-cinnamon; a teaspoonful of butter.</p>

<p>Boil the cinnamon in the milk. Stir the corn-starch
and flour smooth in a little cold milk or water, and add to
the milk. Beat the yolks light with the sugar, and add.
Take from the fire; take out the cinnamon, and stir in the
butter and vanilla, and pour out on a buttered tin or dish,
letting it be about half an inch thick. When cold and
stiff, cut into pieces about three inches long and two wide.
Dip carefully in sifted cracker-crumbs; then in a beaten
egg, and in crumbs again, and fry like croquettes. Dry
in the oven four or five minutes, and serve at once. Very
delicious.</p>


<p>PEACH FRITTERS.</p>

<p>Make a batter as on p. 208. Take the fruit from a
small can of peaches, lay it on a plate, and sprinkle with
a spoonful of sugar and a glass of wine. Let it lie an
hour, turning it once. Dip each piece in batter, and drop
in boiling lard, or chop and mix with batter. Prepare the
juice for a sauce as on p. 172. Fresh peaches or slices
of tender apple can be used in the same way. Drain
on brown paper, and sift sugar over them, before they
go to table.</p>


<p>FREEZING OF ICE CREAM AND ICES.</p>

<p>With a patent freezer ice cream and ices can be prepared
with less trouble than puff paste. The essential
points are the use of rock-salt, and pounding the ice into
small bits. Set the freezer in the centre of the tub. Put
<a name="Page_250" id="Page_250"></a>a layer of ice three inches deep, then of salt, and so on
till the tub is full, ending with ice. Put in the cream, and
turn for ten minutes, or till you can not turn the beater.
Then take off the cover, scrape down the sides, and beat
like cake for at least five minutes. Pack the tub again,
having let off all water; cover with a piece of old carpet.
If molds are used, fill as soon as the cream is frozen;
pack them full of it, and lay in ice and salt. When ready
to turn out, dip in warm water a moment. Handle gently,
and serve at once.</p>


<p>ICE CREAM OF CREAM.</p>

<p>To a gallon of sweet cream add two and a quarter
pounds of sugar, and four tablespoonfuls of vanilla or
other extract, as freezing destroys flavors. Freeze as
directed.</p>


<p>ICE CREAM WITH EGGS.</p>

<p>Boil two quarts of rich milk, and add to it, when boiling,
four tablespoonfuls of corn-starch wet with a cup of cold
milk. Boil for ten minutes, stirring often. Beat twelve
eggs to a creamy froth with a heaping quart of sugar, and
stir in, taking from the fire as soon as it boils. When
cold, add three tablespoonfuls of vanilla or lemon, and
two quarts either of cream or very rich milk, and freeze.
For strawberry or raspberry cream allow the juice of one
quart of berries to a gallon of cream. For chocolate
cream grate half a pound of chocolate; melt it with one
pint of sugar and a little water, and add to above rule.</p>


<p>WATER ICES.</p>

<p>Are simply fruit juices and water made very sweet, with
a few whites of eggs whipped stiff, and added.<a name="Page_251" id="Page_251"></a>
For lemon ice take two quarts of water, one quart of
sugar, and the juice of seven lemons. Mix and add, after
it has begun to freeze, the stiffly-beaten whites of four
eggs. Orange ice is made in the same way.</p>


<p>WINE JELLY.</p>

<p>One box of gelatine; one cup of wine; three lemons,
juice and rind; a small stick of cinnamon; one quart of
boiling water; one pint of white sugar.</p>

<p>Soak the gelatine in one cup of cold water half an hour.
Boil the cinnamon in the quart of water for five minutes,
and then add the yellow rind of the lemons cut very thin,
and boil a minute. Take out cinnamon and rinds, and
add sugar, wine, and gelatine. Strain at once through a
fine strainer into molds, and, when cold, set on the ice to
harden. To turn out, dip for a moment in hot water. A
pint of wine is used, if liked very strong.</p>



<p>LEMON JELLY.</p>

<p>Omit the wine, but make as above in other respects,
using five lemons. Oranges are nice also. The juice may
be used as in lemon jelly, or the little sections may be
peeled as carefully as possible of all the white skin. Pour
a little lemon jelly in a mold, and let it harden. Then
fill with four oranges prepared in this way, and pour in
liquid jelly to cover them. Candied fruit may be used instead.
The jelly reserved to add to the mold can be kept
in a warm place till the other has hardened. Fresh strawberries
or raspberries, or cut-up peaches, can be used instead
of oranges.</p>

<h2><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252"></a><a name="CANNING_AND_PRESERVING" id="CANNING_AND_PRESERVING" />CANNING AND PRESERVING.</h2>

<p>Canning is so simple an operation that it is unfortunate
that most people consider it difficult. The directions generally
given are so troublesome that one can not wonder it
is not attempted oftener; but it need be hardly more care
than the making of apple sauce, which, by the way, can
always be made while apples are plenty, and canned for
spring use. In an experience of years, not more than one
can in a hundred has ever been lost, and fruit put up at
home is far nicer than any from factories.</p>

<p>In canning, see first that the jars are clean, the rubbers
whole and in perfect order, and the tops clean and ready
to screw on. Fill the jars with hot (not boiling) water half
an hour before using, and have them ready on a table
sufficiently large to hold the preserving-kettle, a dish-pan
quarter full of hot water, and the cans. Have ready, also,
a deep plate, large enough to hold two cans; a silver
spoon; an earthen cup with handle; and, if possible, a can-filler,&mdash;that
is, a small tin in strainer-shape, but without
the bottom, and fitting about the top. The utmost speed
is needed in filling and screwing down tops, and for this
reason every thing <i>must be</i> ready beforehand.</p>

<p>In filling the can let the fruit come to the top; then
run the spoon-handle down on all sides to let out the air;
pour in juice till it runs over freely, and screw the top
down at once, using a towel to protect the hand. Set at
once in a dish-pan of water, as this prevents the table
being stained by juice, and also its hardening on the hot
can. Proceed in this way till all are full; wipe them dry;
<a name="Page_253" id="Page_253"></a>and, when cold, give the tops an additional screw, as the
glass contracts in cooling, and loosens them. Label them,
and keep in a dark, cool closet. When the fruit is used,
wash the jar, and dry carefully at the back of the stove.
Wash the rubber also, and dry on a towel, putting it in
the jar when dry, and screwing on the top. They are
then ready for next year's use. Mason's cans are decidedly
the best for general use.</p>


<p>GENERAL RULES FOR CANNING.</p>

<p>For all small fruits allow one-third of a pound of sugar
to a pound of fruit. Make it into a sirup with a teacup
of water to each pound, and skim carefully. Throw in the
fruit, and boil ten minutes, canning as directed. Raspberries
and blackberries are best; huckleberries are excellent
for pies, and easily canned. Pie-plant can be stewed
till tender. It requires half a pound of sugar to a pound
of fruit.</p>

<p>For peaches, gages, &amp;c, allow the same amount of
sugar as for raspberries. Pare peaches, and can whole or
in halves as preferred. Prick plums and gages with a
large darning-needle to prevent their bursting. In canning
pears, pare and drop at once, into cold water, as this
prevents their turning dark.</p>

<p>Always use a porcelain-lined kettle, and stir either with
a silver or a wooden spoon,&mdash;never an iron one. Currants
are nice mixed with an equal weight of raspberries, and
all fruit is more wholesome canned than in preserves.</p>


<p>TO CAN TOMATOES.</p>

<p>Unless very plenty, it is cheaper to buy these in the tins.
Pour on boiling water to help in removing the skins; fill
<a name="Page_254" id="Page_254"></a>the preserving kettle, but add no water. Boil them five
minutes, and then can. Do not season till ready to use
them for the table. Okra and tomatoes may be scalded
together in equal parts, and canned for soups.</p>


<p>PRESERVES.</p>

<p>Preserves are scarcely needed if canning is nicely done.
They require much more trouble, and are too rich for
ordinary use, a pound of sugar to one of fruit being required.
If made at all, the fruit must be very fresh,
and the sirup perfectly clear. For sirup allow one teacup
of cold water to every pound of sugar, and, as it heats,
add to every three or four pounds the white of an egg.
Skim very carefully, boiling till no more rises, and it is
ready for use. Peaches, pears, green gages, cherries, and
crab-apples are all preserved alike. Peel, stone, and halve
peaches, and boil only a few pieces at a time till clear.
Peel, core, and halve pears. Prick plums and gages several
times. Core crab-apples, and cut half the stem from
cherries. Cook till tender. Put up <i>when cold</i> in small
jars, and paste paper over them.</p>


<p>JAMS.</p>

<p>Make sirup as directed above. Use raspberries, strawberries,
or any small fruit, and boil for half an hour. Put
up in small jars or tumblers; lay papers dipped in brandy
on the fruit, and paste on covers, or use patent jelly-glasses.</p>


<p>MARMALADE.</p>

<p>Quinces make the best; but crab-apples or any sour
apple are also good. Poor quinces, unfit for other use,
can be washed and cut in small pieces, coring, but not
paring them. Allow three-quarters of a pound of sugar
<a name="Page_255" id="Page_255"></a>and a teacupful of water to a pound of fruit, and boil
slowly two hours, stirring and mashing it fine. Strain
through a colander, and put up in glasses or bowls. Peach
marmalade is made in the same way.</p>


<p>CURRANT JELLY.</p>

<p>The fruit must be picked when just ripened, as when
too old it will not form jelly. Look over, and then put
stems and all in a porcelain-lined kettle. Crush a little of
the fruit to form juice, but add no water. As it heats,
jam with a potato-masher; and when hot through, strain
through a jelly-bag. Let all run off that will, before
squeezing the bag. It will be a little clearer than the
squeezed juice. To every pint of this juice add one
pound of best white sugar, taking care that it has not a
blue tinge. Jelly from bluish-white sugars does not harden
well. Boil the juice twenty-five minutes; add the sugar,
and boil for five more. Put up in glasses.</p>


<p>ORANGE MARMALADE.</p>

<p>This recipe, taken from the &quot;New York Evening Post,&quot;
has been thoroughly tested by the author, and found
delicious.</p>

<p>&quot;A recipe for orange marmalade that I think will be
entirely new to most housewives, and that I know is delicious,
comes from an English housekeeper. It is a sweet
that is choice and very healthful. If made now, when
oranges and lemons are plentiful, it may be had at a cost
of from five to six cents for a large glass. The recipe
calls for one dozen oranges (sweet or part bitter), one
half-dozen lemons, and ten pounds of granulated sugar.<a name="Page_256" id="Page_256"></a>
Wash the fruit in tepid water thoroughly, and scrub the
skins with a soft brush to get rid of the possible microbes
that it is said may lurk on the skins of fruit. Dry the
fruit; take a very sharp knife, and on a hard-wood board
slice it very thin. Throw away the thick pieces that come
off from the ends. Save all the seeds, and put them in
one bowl; the sliced fruit in another. Pour half a gallon
of water over the contents of each bowl, and soak for
thirty-six hours. Then put the fruit in your preserving-kettle,
with the water that has been standing on it, and
strain in (through a colander) the water put on the lemon-seeds.
Cook gently two hours; then add the sugar, and
cook another hour, or until the mixture jellies. Test by
trying a little in a saucer. Put away in glasses or cans,
as other jelly.&quot;</p>


<p>FRUIT JELLIES.</p>

<p>Crab-apple, quince, grapes, &amp;c., are all made in the
same way. Allow a teacup of water to a pound of fruit;
boil till very tender; then strain through a cloth, and treat
as currant jelly. Cherries will not jelly without gelatine,
and grapes are sometimes troublesome. Where gelatine
is needed, allow a package to two quarts of juice.</p>


<p>CANDIED FRUITS.</p>

<p>Make a sirup as for preserves, and boil any fruit, prepared
as directed, until tender. Let them stand two days
in the sirup. Take out; drain carefully; lay them on
plates; sift sugar over them, and dry either in the sun or
in a moderately warm oven.</p>

<h2><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257"></a><a name="PICKLES_AND_CATCHUPS" id="PICKLES_AND_CATCHUPS" />PICKLES AND CATCHUPS.</h2>

<p>Sour pickles are first prepared by soaking in a brine
made of one pint of coarse salt to six quarts of water.
Boil this, and pour it scalding hot over the pickle, cucumbers,
green tomatoes, &amp;c. Cucumbers may lie in this a
week, or a month even, but must be soaked in cold water
two days before using them. Other pickles lie only a
month.</p>

<p>Sweet pickles are made from any fruit used in preserving,
allowing three, or sometimes four, pounds of sugar to
a quart of best cider vinegar, and boiling both together.</p>


<p>CUCUMBER PICKLES.</p>

<p>Half a bushel of cucumbers, small, and as nearly as
possible the same size. Make a brine as directed, and
pour over them. Next morning prepare a pickle as follows:
Two gallons of cider vinegar; one quart of brown
sugar. Boil, and skim carefully, and add to it half a
pint of white mustard seed; one ounce of stick-cinnamon
broken fine; one ounce of alum; half an ounce
each of whole cloves and black pepper-corns. Boil five
minutes, and pour over the cucumbers. They can be
used in a week. In a month scald the vinegar once more,
and pour over them.</p>


<p>TOMATO CHUTNEY.</p>

<p>One peck of green tomatoes; six large green peppers;
six onions; one cup of salt. Chop onions and peppers
fine, slice the tomatoes about quarter of an inch thick,
<a name="Page_258" id="Page_258"></a>and sprinkle the salt over all. In the morning drain off
all the salt and water, and put the tomatoes in a porcelain-lined
kettle. Mix together thoroughly two pounds of
brown sugar; quarter of a pound of mustard-seed; one
ounce each of powdered cloves, cinnamon, ginger, and
black pepper; half an ounce of allspice; quarter of an
ounce each of cayenne pepper and ground mustard. Stir
all into the tomatoes; cover with cider vinegar,&mdash;about
two quarts,&mdash;and boil slowly for two hours. Very nice,
but very hot. If wanted less so, omit the cayenne and
ground mustard.</p>


<p>RIPE CUCUMBER OR MELON-RIND PICKLES.</p>

<p>Pare, seed, and cut lengthwise into four pieces, or in
thick slices. Boil an ounce of alum in one gallon of
water, and pour over them, letting them stand at least half
a day on the back of the stove. Take them out, and let
them lie in cold water until cold. Have ready a quart
of vinegar, three pounds of brown sugar, and an ounce of
stick-cinnamon and half an ounce cloves. Boil the vinegar
and sugar, and skim; add the spices and the melon
rind or cucumber, and boil for half an hour.</p>


<p>SWEET-PICKLED PEACHES, PEARS, OR PLUMS.</p>

<p>Seven pounds of fruit; four pounds of brown sugar;
one quart of vinegar; one ounce of cloves; two ounces of
stick-cinnamon. Pare the peaches or not, as liked. If
unpared, wash and wipe each one to rub off the wool.
Boil vinegar and sugar, and skim well; add spices, sticking
one or two cloves in each peach. Boil ten minutes,
and take out into jars. Boil the sirup until reduced one-half,
and pour over them. Pears are peeled and cored;
<a name="Page_259" id="Page_259"></a>apples peeled, cored, and quartered. They can all be put
in stone jars; but Mason's cans are better.</p>


<p>TOMATO CATCHUP.</p>

<p>Boil one bushel of ripe tomatoes, skins and all, and, when
soft, strain through a colander. Be sure that it is a colander,
and <i>not</i> a sieve, for reasons to be given. Add to
this pulp two quarts of best vinegar; one cup of salt;
two pounds of brown sugar; half an ounce of cayenne
pepper; three ounces each of powdered allspice and mace;
two ounces of powdered cinnamon; three ounces of
celery-seed. Mix spices and sugar well together, and stir
into the tomato; add the vinegar, and stir thoroughly.
Now strain the whole through a <i>sieve</i>. A good deal of
rather thick pulp will not go through. Pour all that runs
through into a large kettle, and let it boil slowly till reduced
one-half. Put the thick pulp into a smaller kettle,
and boil twenty minutes. Use as a pickle with cold
meats or with boiled fish. A teacupful will flavor a soup.
In the old family rule from which this is taken, a pint of
brandy is added ten minutes before the catchup is done;
but it is not necessary, though an improvement. Bottle,
and keep in a cool, dark place. It keeps for years.</p>

water. Cool, and pull white.<a name="Page_260" id="Page_260"></a></p>


<p>CHOCOLATE CARAMELS.</p>

<p>One cup of sugar; one cup of milk; half a cup of
molasses; two ounces of grated chocolate. Melt the
chocolate in a very little water; add the sugar, milk, and
molasses, and boil twenty minutes, or until very thick.
Pour in buttered pans, and cut in small squares when cool.</p>


<p>MOLASSES CANDY.</p>

<p>Two cups of molasses, one of brown sugar, a teaspoonful
of butter, and a tablespoonful of vinegar. Boil
from twenty minutes to half an hour. Pour in a buttered
dish, and pull when cool.</p>


<p>NUT CANDY.</p>

<p>Make molasses candy as above. Just before taking it
from the fire, add a heaping pint of shelled peanuts or
walnuts. Cut in strips before it is quite cold.</p>


<p>COCOANUT DROPS.</p>

<p>One cocoanut grated; half its weight in powdered
sugar; whites of two eggs; one teaspoonful of corn-starch.
Mix corn-starch and sugar; add cocoanut, and
then whites of eggs beaten to a stiff froth. Make in little
cones, and bake on buttered paper in a slow oven.</p>


<p>CHOCOLATE CREAMS.</p>

<p>One pound of granulated sugar; half a pound of chocolate;
one teaspoonful of acetic acid; one tablespoonful
of water; one teaspoonful of vanilla. Melt the sugar
slowly, wetting a little with the water. Add the acid
and vanilla, and boil till sugary, trying <i>very</i> often by
stirring a little in a saucer. When sugary, take from the
<a name="Page_261" id="Page_261"></a>fire, and stir until almost hard; then roll in little balls,
and put on a buttered plate. Melt the chocolate in two
tablespoonfuls of water with a cup of sugar, and boil
five minutes. When just warm, dip in the little balls till
well coated, and lay on plates to dry. Very nice.</p>

<p>GENERAL HINTS.</p>

<p>As recovery from any illness depends in large part upon
proper food, and as the appetite of the sick is always
capricious and often requires tempting, the greatest pains
should be taken in the preparation of their meals. If
only dry toast and tea, let each be perfect, remembering
instructions for making each, and serving on the freshest
of napkins and in dainty china. A <i>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</i> service is
very nice for use in a sick-room; and in any case a very
small teapot can be had, that the tea may always be made
fresh. Prepare only a small amount of any thing, and
never discuss it beforehand. A surprise will often rouse
a flagging appetite. Be ready, too, to have your best
attempts rejected. The article disliked one day may be
just what is wanted the next. Never let food stand in a
sick-room,&mdash;for it becomes hateful to a sensitive patient,&mdash;and
have every thing as daintily clean as possible.
Remember, too, that gelatine is not nourishing, and do not
be satisfied to feed a patient on jellies. Bread from any
brown flour will be more nourishing than wheat. Corn
meal is especially valuable for thin, chilly invalids, as it
<a name="Page_262" id="Page_262"></a>contains so much heat. In severe sickness a glass tube
is very useful for feeding gruels and drinks, and little
white china boats with spouts are also good. A wooden
tray with legs six or seven inches high, to stand on the
bed, is very convenient for serving meals. Let ventilation,
sunshine, and absolute cleanliness rule in the sick-room.
Never raise a dust, but wipe the carpet with a
damp cloth, and pick up bits as needed. Never let lamp
or sun light shine directly in the eyes, and, when the patient
shows desire to sleep, darken the room a little. Never
whisper, nor wear rustling dresses, nor become irritated
at exactions, but keep a cheerful countenance, which helps
often far more than drugs. Experience must teach the
rest.</p>


<p>BEEF TEA, OR ESSENCE OF BEEF.</p>

<p>Cut a pound of perfectly lean beef into small bits. Do
not allow any particle of fat to remain. Put in a wide-mouthed
bottle, cork tightly, and set in a kettle of cold
water. Boil for three hours; pour off the juice, which is
now completely extracted from the meat. There will be
probably a small cupful. Season with a saltspoonful of
salt. This is given in extreme sickness, feeding a teaspoonful
at a time.</p>


<p>BEEF TEA FOR CONVALESCENTS.</p>

<p>One pound of lean beef prepared as above. Add a
pint of cold water,&mdash;rain-water is best,&mdash;and soak for an
hour. Cover closely, and boil for ten minutes; or put in
the oven, and let it remain an hour. Pour off the juice,
season with half a teaspoonful of salt, and use. A little
celery salt makes a change.<a name="Page_263" id="Page_263"></a></p>


<p>CHICKEN BROTH.</p>

<p>The bones and a pound of meat from a chicken put
in three pints of cold water. Skim thoroughly when it
comes to a boil, add a teaspoonful of salt, and simmer for
three hours. Strain and serve. A tablespoonful of
soaked rice or tapioca may be added after the broth is
strained. Return it in this case to the fire, and boil half
an hour longer.</p>


<p>CHICKEN JELLY.</p>

<p>Boil chicken as for broth, but reduce the liquid to half a
pint. Strain into a cup or little mold, and turn out when
cold.</p>


<p>CHICKEN PANADA.</p>

<p>Take the breast of the chicken boiled as above; cut in
bits, and pound smooth in a mortar. Take a teacupful of
bread-crumbs; soak them soft in warm milk, or, if liked
better, in a little broth. Mix them with the chicken; add
a saltspoonful of salt, and, if allowed, a pinch of mace;
and serve in a cup with a spoon.</p>


<p>BEEF, TAPIOCA, AND EGG BROTH.</p>

<p>One pound of lean beef, prepared as for beef tea, and
soaked one hour in a quart of cold water. Boil slowly for
two hours. Strain it. Add a half teaspoonful of salt,
and half a cupful of tapioca which has been washed and
soaked an hour in warm water. Boil slowly half an hour.
Serve in a shallow bowl, in which a poached egg is put at
the last, or stir a beaten egg into one cup of the boiling
soup, and serve at once with wafers or crackers.</p>


<p>MUTTON BROTH.</p>

<p>Made as chicken broth. Any strong stock, from which
the fat has been taken, answers for broths.<a name="Page_264" id="Page_264"></a></p>


<p>OATMEAL GRUEL.</p>

<p>Have ready, in a double boiler, one quart of boiling
water with a teaspoonful of salt, and sprinkle in two tablespoonfuls
of fine oatmeal. Boil an hour; then strain, and
serve with cream or milk and sugar if ordered. Farina
gruel is made in the same way.</p>


<p>INDIAN OR CORN MEAL GRUEL.</p>

<p>One quart of boiling water; one teaspoonful of salt.
Mix three tablespoonfuls of corn meal with a little cold
water, and stir in slowly. Boil one hour; strain and serve,
a cupful at once.</p>


<p>MILK PORRIDGE.</p>

<p>One quart of boiling milk; two tablespoonfuls of flour
mixed with a little cold milk and half a teaspoonful of
salt. Stir into the milk, and boil half an hour.</p>

<p>Strain and serve. If allowed, a handful of raisins and
a little grated nutmeg may be boiled with it.</p>


<p>WINE WHEY.</p>

<p>Boil one cup of new milk, and add half a wine-glass of
good sherry or Madeira wine. Boil a minute; strain, and
use with or without sugar as liked.</p>


<p>EGG-NOG.</p>

<p>One egg; one tablespoonful of sugar; half a cup of
milk; one tablespoonful of wine.</p>

<p>Beat the sugar and yolk to a cream; add the wine, and
then the milk. Beat the white to a stiff froth, and stir in
very lightly.</p>

<p>Omit the milk where more condensed nourishment is
desired.<a name="Page_265" id="Page_265"></a></p>


<p>ARROW-ROOT OR RICE JELLY.</p>

<p>Two heaping teaspoonfuls of either arrow-root or rice
flour; a pinch of salt; a heaping tablespoonful of sugar;
one cup of boiling water.</p>

<p>Mix the flour with a little cold water, and add to the
boiling water. Boil until transparent, and pour into cups
or small molds. For a patient with summer complaint,
flavor by boiling a stick of cinnamon in it. For a fever
patient add the juice of quarter of a lemon.</p>


<p>DR. GAUNT'S RICE JELLY.</p>

<p>Take four tablespoonfuls of rice, and boil it hard in
three pints of water for twenty minutes. Let simmer for
two hours. Then force through fine hair strainer, and
allow it to cool. Place in an ice chest over night.</p>

<p>DIRECTIONS FOR USE.</p>

<p>Dissolve two tablespoonfuls of the rice jelly in each
one-half pint of milk.</p>


<p>RICE WATER FOR DRINK.</p>

<p>One quart of boiling water; a pinch of salt; one tablespoonful
of rice or rice flour. Boil half an hour, and
strain.</p>


<p>TOAST WATER.</p>

<p>Toast two slices of bread very brown, but do not scorch.
Put in a pitcher, and while hot pour on one quart of cold
water. Let it stand half an hour, and it is ready for
use.<a name="Page_266" id="Page_266"></a></p>


<p>CRUST COFFEE.</p>

<p>Two thick slices of graham or Boston brown bread
toasted as brown as possible. Pour on one pint of boiling
water, and steep ten minutes. Serve with milk and sugar,
like coffee.</p>


<p>BEEF JUICE.</p>

<p>Broil a thick piece of beef steak three minutes. Squeeze
all the juice with a lemon-squeezer into a cup; salt very
lightly, and give like beef tea.</p>


<p>JELLY AND ICE.</p>

<p>Break ice in bits no bigger than a pea. A large pin will
break off bits from a lump very easily. To a tablespoonful
add one of wine jelly broken up. It is very refreshing
in fever.</p>


<p>PANADA.</p>

<p>Lay in a bowl two Boston or graham crackers split;
sprinkle on a pinch of salt, and cover with boiling water.
Set the bowl in a saucepan of boiling water, and let it
stand half an hour, till the crackers look clear. Slide
into a hot saucer without breaking, and eat with cream
and sugar. As they are only good hot, do just enough
for the patient's appetite at one time.</p>


<p>MILK TOAST.</p>

<p>Toast one or two thin slices of bread; dip quickly in a
little salted boiling water, and spread on a little butter.
Boil a teacupful of milk; thicken with a teaspoonful of
flour mixed in a little cold water with a pinch of salt; lay
<a name="Page_267" id="Page_267"></a>the toast in a small, hot, deep plate, and pour over the
milk. Cream toast is made in the same way.</p>


<p>BEEF SANDWICH.</p>

<p>Two or three tablespoonfuls of raw, very tender beef,
scraped fine, and spread between two slices of slightly
buttered bread. Sprinkle on pepper and salt.</p>


<p>PREPARED FLOUR.</p>

<p>Tie a pint of flour tightly in a cloth, and boil for four
hours. Scrape off the outer crust, and the inside will be
found to be a dry ball. Grate this as required, allowing
one tablespoonful wet in cold milk to a pint of boiling
milk, and boiling till smooth. Add a saltspoonful of salt.
This is excellent for summer complaint, whether in adults
or children. The beaten white of an egg can also be
stirred in if ordered. If this porridge is used from the
beginning of the complaint, little or no medicine will be
required.</p>


<p>PARCHED RICE.</p>

<p>Roast to a deep brown as you would coffee, and then
cook as in rule for boiled rice, p. 199, and eat with cream
and sugar.</p>


<p>RICE COFFEE.</p>

<p>Parch as above, and grind. Allow half a cup to a quart
of boiling water, and let it steep fifteen minutes. Strain,
and drink plain, or with milk and sugar.</p>


<p>HERB TEAS.</p>

<p>For the dried herbs allow one teaspoonful to a cup of
boiling water. Pour the water on them; cover, and steep
<a name="Page_268" id="Page_268"></a>ten minutes or so. Camomile tea is good for sleeplessness;
calamus and catnip for babies' colic; and cinnamon
for hemorrhages and summer complaint. Slippery-elm
and flax-seed are also good for the latter.</p>


<p>BEEF STEAK OR CHOPS, ETC.</p>

<p>With beef steak, cut a small thick piece of a nice
shape; broil carefully, and serve on a very hot plate, salting
a little, but using no butter unless allowed by the
physician.</p>

<p>Chops should be trimmed very neatly, and cooked in
the same way. A nice way of serving a chop is to broil,
and cut in small bits. Have ready a baked potato. Cut
a slice from the top; take out the inside, and season as for
eating; add the chop, and return all to the skin, covering
it, and serving as hot as possible.</p>

<p>When appetite has returned, poached eggs on toast, a
little salt cod with cream, or many of the dishes given
under the head of Breakfast Dishes, are relished. Prepare
small quantities, preserving the right proportions
of seasoning.</p>


<p>TAPIOCA JELLY.</p>

<p>Two ounces of tapioca,&mdash;about two tablespoonfuls,&mdash;soaked
over-night in one cup of cold water. In the morning
add a second cup of cold water, and boil till very
clear. Add quarter of a cup of sugar; two teaspoonfuls
of brandy or four of wine; or the thin rind and juice of
a lemon may be used instead. Very good hot, but better
poured into small molds wet with cold water, and turned
out when firm.<a name="Page_269" id="Page_269"></a></p>


<p>TAPIOCA GRUEL.</p>

<p>Half a cup of tapioca soaked over-night in a cup of
cold water. In the morning add a quart of milk and half
a teaspoonful of salt, and boil three hours. It can be
eaten plain, or with sugar and wine. Most of the blancmanges
and creams given can be prepared in smaller
quantities, if allowed. Baked custards can be made with
the whites of the eggs, if a very delicate one is desired.</p>


<p>APPLE WATER.</p>

<p>Two roasted sour apples, or one pint of washed dried
apples. Pour on one quart of boiling water; cover, and
let it stand half an hour, when it is ready for use.</p>

<p>SOFT SOAP.</p>

<p>All mutton and ham fat should be melted and strained
into a large stone pot. The practice of throwing lumps
of fat into a pot, and waiting till there are several pounds
before trying them out, is a disgusting one, as often such
a receptacle is alive with maggots. Try out the fat, and
strain as carefully as you would lard or beef drippings,
and it is then always ready for use. If concentrated lye
or potash, which comes in little tins, is used, directions will
be found on the tins. Otherwise allow a pound of stone
potash to every pound of grease. Twelve pounds of each
will make a barrel of soft soap.</p>

<p>Crack the potash in small pieces. Put in a large kettle
with two gallons of water, and boil till dissolved. Then
add the grease, and, when melted, pour all into a tight
barrel. Fill it up with boiling water, and for a week, stir
daily for five or ten minutes. It will gradually become
like jelly.</p>


<p>TO PURIFY SINKS AND DRAINS.</p>

<p>To one pound of common copperas add one gallon of
boiling water, and use when dissolved. The copperas is
poison, and must never be left unmarked.</p>


<p>FURNITURE POLISH.</p>

<p>Mix two tablespoonfuls of sweet or linseed oil with a
tablespoonful of turpentine, and rub on with a piece of
flannel, polishing with a dry piece.<a name="Page_271" id="Page_271"></a></p>


<p>TO KEEP EGGS.</p>

<p>Be sure that the eggs are fresh. Place them points
down in a stone jar or tight firkin, and pour over them
the following brine, which is enough for a hundred and
fifty:&mdash;</p>

<p>One pint of slacked lime, one pint of salt, two ounces
of cream of tartar, and four gallons of water. Boil all
together for ten minutes; skim, and, when cold, pour it
over the eggs. They can also be kept in salt tightly
packed, but not as well.</p>


<p>TO MAKE HARD WATER SOFT.</p>

<p>Dissolve in one gallon of boiling water a pound and a
quarter of washing soda, and a quarter of a pound of
borax. In washing clothes allow quarter of a cup of this
to every gallon of water.</p>


<p>TO TAKE OUT FRUIT-STAINS.</p>

<p>Stretch the stained part tightly over a bowl, and pour
on boiling water till it is free from spot.</p>


<p>TO TAKE OUT INK-SPOTS.</p>

<p>Ink spilled upon carpets or on woolen table-covers can
be taken out, if washed at once in cold water. Change
the water often, and continue till the stain is gone.</p>


<p>MIXED SPICES.</p>

<p>Three heaping tablespoonfuls of ground cinnamon, one
heaping one each of clove and mace, and one even one of
allspice. Mix thoroughly, and use for dark cakes and for
puddings.<a name="Page_272" id="Page_272"></a></p>


<p>SPICE SALT.</p>

<p>Four ounces of salt; one of black pepper; one each of
thyme, sweet marjoram, and summer savory; half an ounce
each of clove, allspice, and mace; quarter of an ounce of
cayenne pepper; one ounce of celery salt. Mix all
together; sift three times, and keep closely covered.
Half an ounce will flavor a stuffing for roast meat; and a
tablespoonful is nice in many soups and stews.</p>


<p>TO WASH GREASY TIN AND IRON.</p>

<p>Pour a few drops of ammonia into every greasy roasting-pan,
first half-filling with warm water. A bottle of
ammonia should always stand near the sink for such uses.
Never allow dirty pots or pans to stand and dry; for it
doubles the labor of washing. Pour in water, and use
ammonia, and the work is half done.</p>


<p>TO CLEAN BRASS AND COPPER.</p>

<p>Scrape a little rotten-stone fine, and make into a paste
with sweet oil. Rub on with a piece of flannel; let it dry,
and polish with a chamois-skin. Copper is cleaned either
with vinegar and salt mixed in equal parts, or with oxalic
acid. The latter is a deadly poison, and must be treated
accordingly.</p>


<p>WEIGHTS AND MEASURES.</p>

<p>As many families have no scales for weighing, a table of
measures is given which can be used instead. Weighing
is always best, but not always convenient. The cup used
is the ordinary coffee or kitchen cup, holding half a pint.
A set of tin measures, from a gill up to a quart, is very
useful in all cooking operations.</p>

<p><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273"></a>One quart of sifted flour is one pound.</p>

<p>One pint of granulated sugar is one pound.</p>

<p>Two cups of butter packed are one pound.</p>

<p>Ten eggs are one pound.</p>

<p>Five cupfuls of sifted flour are one pound.</p>

<p>A wine-glassful is half a gill.</p>

<p>Eight even tablespoonfuls are a gill.</p>

<p>Four even saltspoonfuls make a teaspoonful.</p>

<p>A saltspoonful is a good measure of salt for all custards,
puddings, blancmanges, &amp;c.</p>

<p>One teaspoonful of soda to a quart of flour.</p>

<p>Two teaspoonfuls of soda to one of cream of tartar.</p>

<p>The teaspoonful given in all these receipts is just
rounded full, not heaped.</p>

<p>Two heaping teaspoonfuls of baking powder to one
quart of flour.</p>

<p>One cup of sweet or sour milk as wetting for one quart
of flour.</p>

<p>DEVILED HAM.</p>

<p>For this purpose, use either the knuckle or any odds
and ends remaining. Cut off all dark or hard bits, and
see that at least a quarter of the amount is fat. Chop
as finely as possible, reducing it almost to a paste. For
a pint-bowl of this, make a dressing as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276"></a>One even tablespoonful of sugar; one even teaspoonful
of ground mustard; one saltspoonful of Cayenne pepper;
one teacupful of good vinegar. Mix the sugar, mustard,
and pepper thoroughly, and add the vinegar little by
little. Stir it into the chopped ham, and pack it in small
molds, if it is to be served as a lunch or supper relish,
turning out upon a small platter and garnishing with
parsley.</p>

<p>For sandwiches, cut the bread very thin; butter lightly,
and spread with about a teaspoonful of the deviled ham.
The root of a boiled tongue can be prepared in the same
way. If it is to be kept some time, pack in little jars,
and pour melted butter over the top.</p>

<h2><a name="HINTS_TO_TEACHERS" id="HINTS_TO_TEACHERS" /><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280"></a>HINTS TO TEACHERS.</h2>


<p>In beginning with a class of school-girls from fourteen
to eighteen, it is best to let the first two or three lessons
be demonstration lessons; that is, to have all operations
performed by the teacher. An assistant may be chosen
from the class, who can help in any required way. The
receipts for the day should first be read, and copied
plainly by all the pupils. Each process must be fully explained,
and be as daintily and deftly performed as possible.
Not more than six dishes at the most can be prepared
in one lesson, and four will be the usual number.
Two lessons a week, from two to three hours each, are all
for which the regular school-course gives time; and there
should be not more than one day between, as many dishes
can not be completed in one lesson.</p>

<p>After yeast and bread have been once made by the
teacher, bread should be the first item in every lesson
thereafter, and the class made a practice-class. Each
pupil should make bread twice,&mdash;once under the teacher's
supervision, and at least once entirely alone. In a large
class this may occupy the entire time in the school-year.
Let the most important operations be thoroughly learned,
even if there is little variety. To make and bake all
forms of bread, to broil a steak, boil a potato, and make
good tea and coffee, may not seem sufficient result for a
<a name="Page_281" id="Page_281"></a>year's work; but the girl who can do this has mastered
the principles of cooking, and is abundantly able to go on
alone.</p>

<p>The fire should be made and cared for by each in turn,
and the best modes of washing dishes, and keeping the
room and stores in the best order, be part of each lesson.</p>

<p>Once a week let a topic be given out, on which all are
to write, any ingredient in cooking being chosen, and the
papers read and marked in order of merit.</p>

<p>Once a month examine on these topics, and on what has
been learned. Let digestion and forms of food be well
understood, and spare no pains to make the lesson attractive
and stimulating to interest.</p>

<p>In classes for ladies the work is usually done entirely
by the teacher, and at least five dishes are prepared. A
large class can thus be taught; but the results will never
be as satisfactory as in a practice-class, though the latter
is of course much more troublesome to the teacher, as it
requires far more patience and tact to watch and direct the
imperfect doing of a thing than to do it one's self.</p>

<p>A class lunch or supper is a pleasant way of demonstrating
what progress has been made; and, in such entertainment,
do not aim at great variety, but insist upon the
perfect preparation of a few things. To lay and decorate
a table prettily is an accomplishment, and each classroom
should have enough china and glass to admit of
this.</p>

<p>To indicate the method which the writer has found
practicable and useful, a course of twelve lessons is given,
embracing the essential operations; and beyond this the
teacher can construct her own bills of fare. When the
<a name="Page_282" id="Page_282"></a>making of bread begins, it will be found that not more
than two or three other things can be made at one lesson.
Let one of these be a simple cake or pudding for the
benefit of the class, whose interest is wonderfully stimulated
by something good to eat.</p>

<p>Large white aprons and small half-sleeves to draw on
over the dress-sleeves are essential, and must be insisted
upon. A little cap of Swiss muslin is pretty, and finishes
the uniform well, but is not a necessity.</p>

<p>For the rest each teacher must judge for herself, only
remembering to <i>demand the most absolute neatness</i> in all
work done, and to <i>give the most perfect patience</i> no matter
how stupid the pupil may seem.</p>

<h3><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294"></a>SOME PASSAGES IN THE PRACTICE</h3>
<h3>OF DR. MARTHA SCARBOROUGH.</h3>

<p class="center">BY HELEN CAMPBELL.</p>

<p class="center"><i>16mo. Cloth. Price, $1.00.</i></p>

<p>Besides being equal to Mrs. Campbell's best work in the
past, it is strikingly original in presenting the ethics of
the body as imperiously claiming recognition in the radical
cure of inebriety. It forces attention to the physical and
spiritual value of foods, and weaves precedent and precept
into one of the most beguiling stories of recent date.</p>

<blockquote><p>It is the gospel of good food, with the added influence of fresh air, sunlight,
cleanliness, and physical exercise that occupy profitably the attention of Helen
Campbell. Martha is a baby when the story begins, and a child not yet in her
teens when the narrative comes to an end, but she has a salutary power over
many lives. Her father is a wise country physician, who makes his chaise, in his
daily progress about the hills, serve as his little daughter's cradle and kindergarten.
When she gets old enough to understand he expounds to her his views of
the sins committed against hygiene, and his lessons sink into an appreciative
mind. When he encounters particularly hard cases she applies his principles
with unfailing logic, and is able to suggest helpful means of cure. The old doctor
is delightfully sagacious in demonstrating how the confirmed pie-eater marries the
tea inebriate, with the result in doughnut-devouring, dyspeptic, and consumptive
offspring. &quot;What did they die of?&quot; asked little Martha, in the village graveyard;
and her father answers solemnly, &quot;Intemperance.&quot; So Martha declares
that she will be a &quot;food doctor,&quot; and later on she helps her father in saving
several victims of strong drink. The book is one that should find hosts of
earnest readers, for its admonitions are sadly needed, not in the country alone, but
in the city, where, if better ideas of diet prevail, people have yet as a rule a long
way to go before they attain the path of wisdom. Meanwhile it remains true, as
Mrs. Campbell makes Dr Scarborough declare, that the cabbage soup and black
bread of the poorest French peasants are really better suited to the sustenance of
healthy life than the &quot;messes&quot; that pass for food in many parts of rural New
England.&mdash;<i>The Beacon.</i></p></blockquote>

<h3><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295"></a>ROGER BERKELEY'S PROBATION.</h3>

<p class="center">A Story.</p>

<p class="center">BY HELEN CAMPBELL,</p>

<p class="center"><i>Author of &quot;Prisoners of Poverty,&quot; &quot;Mrs. Herndon's Income,&quot;
&quot;Miss Melinda's Opportunity,&quot; &quot;The What-to-do Club,&quot; etc.</i></p>

<p class="center">16mo, cloth, price, $1.00; paper, 50 cents.</p>

<blockquote><p>This story is on the scale of a cabinet picture. It presents interesting
figures, natural situations, and warm colors. Written in a quiet key, it is
yet moving, and the letter from Bolton describing the fortunate sale of
Roger's painting of &quot;The Factory Bell&quot; sends a tear of sympathetic joy
to the reader's eye. Roger Berkeley was a young American art student in
Paris, called home by the mortal sickness of his mother, and detained at
home by the spendthriftness of his father and the embarrassment that had
overtaken the family affairs through the latter cause. A concealed mortgage
on the old homestead, the mysterious disappearance of a package of
bonds intended for Roger's student use, and the paralytic incapacity of the
father to give the information which his conscience prompted him to give,
have a share in the development of the story. Roger is obliged for the
time to abandon his art work, and takes a situation in a mill; and this trying
diversion from his purpose is his &quot;probation.&quot; How he profits by
this loss is shown in the result. The mill-life gives Mrs. Campbell opportunity
to express herself characteristically in behalf of down-trodden
&quot;labor.&quot; The whole story is simple, natural, sweet, and tender; and the
figures of Connie, poor little cripple, and Miss Medora Flint, angular and
snappish domestic, lend picturesqueness to its group of characters.&mdash;<i>Literary

<blockquote><p>&quot;Mrs. Helen Campbell has written 'Miss Melinda's Opportunity' with a
definite purpose in view, and this purpose will reveal itself to the eyes of all of its
philanthropic readers. The true aim of the story is to make life more real and
pleasant to the young girls who spend the greater part of the day toiling in the
busy stores of New York. Just as in the 'What-to-do Club' the social level of
village life was lifted several grades higher, so are the little friendly circles of shop-girls
made to enlarge and form clubs in 'Miss Melinda's Opportunity.'&quot;&mdash;<i>Boston
Herald.</i></p>

<p>&quot;'Miss Melinda's Opportunity,' a story by Helen Campbell, is in a somewhat
lighter vein than are the earlier books of this clever author; but it is none
the less interesting and none the less realistic. The plot is unpretentious, and
deals with the simplest and most conventional of themes; but the character-drawing
is uncommonly strong, especially that of Miss Melinda, which is a remarkably
vigorous and interesting transcript from real life, and highly finished to
the slightest details. There is much quiet humor in the book, and it is handled
with skill and reserve. Those who have been attracted to Mrs. Campbell's other
works will welcome the latest of them with pleasure and satisfaction.&quot;&mdash;<i>Saturday
Gazette.</i></p>

<p>&quot;The best book that Helen Campbell has yet produced is her latest story,
'Miss Melinda's Opportunity,' which is especially strong in character-drawing,
and its life sketches are realistic and full of vigor, with a rich vein of humor running
through them. Miss Melinda is a dear lady of middle life, who has finally
found her opportunity to do a great amount of good with her ample pecuniary
means by helping those who have the disposition to help themselves. The story
of how some bright and energetic girls who had gone to New York to earn their
living put a portion of their earnings into a common treasury, and provided themselves
with a comfortable home and good fare for a very small sum per week, is
not only of lively interest, but furnishes hints for other girls in similar circumstances
that may prove of great value. An unpretentious but well-sustained plot
runs through the book, with a happy ending, in which Miss Melinda figures as
the angel that she is.&quot;&mdash;<i>Home Journal.</i></p></blockquote>

<h3><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297"></a>THE WHAT-TO-DO CLUB</h3>

<p class="center">A STORY FOR GIRLS</p>

<p class="center">BY HELEN CAMPBELL.</p>

<p class="center">16mo. Cloth. Price $1.50.</p>

<blockquote><p>&quot;'The What-to-do Club' is an unpretending story. It introduces us to a
dozen or more village girls of varying ranks. One has had superior opportunities;
another exceptional training; two or three have been 'away to school;'
some are farmers' daughters; there is a teacher, two or three poor self-supporters,&mdash;in
fact, about such an assemblage as any town between New York and
Chicago might give us. But while there is a large enough company to furnish a
delightful coterie, there is absolutely no social life among them.... Town and
country need more improving, enthusiastic work to redeem them from barrenness
and indolence. Our girls need a chance to do independent work, to study practical
business, to fill their minds with other thoughts than the petty doings of
neighbors. A What-to-do Club is one step toward higher village life. It is one
step toward disinfecting a neighborhood of the poisonous gossip which floats like
a pestilence around localities which ought to furnish the most desirable homes in
our country.'&quot;&mdash;<i>The Chautauquan.</i></p>

<p>&quot;'The What-to-do Club' is a delightful story for girls, especially for New
England girls, by Helen Campbell. The heroine of the story is Sybil Waite, the
beautiful, resolute, and devoted daughter of a broken-down but highly educated
Vermont lawyer. The story shows how much it is possible for a well-trained and
determined young woman to accomplish when she sets out to earn her own living,
or help others. Sybil begins with odd jobs of carpentering, and becomes an artist
so woodwork. She is first jeered at, then admired, respected, and finally loved
by a worthy man. The book closes pleasantly with John claiming Sybil as his
own. The labors of Sybil and her friends and of the New Jersey 'Busy Bodies,'
which are said to be actual facts, ought to encourage many young women to more
successful competition in the battles of life.'&quot;&mdash;<i>Golden Rule.</i></p>

<p>&quot;In the form of a story, this book suggests ways in which young women
may make money at home, with practical directions for so doing. Stories with a
moral are not usually interesting, but this one is an exception to the rule. The
narrative is lively, the incidents probable and amusing, the characters well-drawn,
and the dialects various and characteristic. Mrs. Campbell is a natural storyteller,
and has the gift of making a tale interesting. Even the recipes for pickles
and preserves, evaporating fruits, raising poultry, and keeping bees, are made
poetic and invested with a certain ideal glamour, and we are thrilled and absorbed
by an array of figures of receipts and expenditures, equally with the changeful
incidents of flirtation, courtship, and matrimony. Fun and pathos, sense and
sentiment, are mingled throughout, and the combination has resulted in one of
the brightest stories of the season.&quot;&mdash;<i>Woman's Journal.</i></p></blockquote>

<p class="center">A NOVEL.</p>

<p class="center">BY HELEN CAMPBELL.</p>

<p class="center">AUTHOR OF &quot;THE WHAT-TO-DO CLUB.&quot;</p>

<p class="center">One volume. 16mo. Cloth. $1.50.</p>

<blockquote><p>&quot;Confirmed novel-readers who have regarded fiction as created for amusement
and luxury alone, lay down this book with a new and serious purpose in life. The
social scientist reads it, and finds the solution of many a tangled problem; the
philanthropist finds in it direction and counsel. A novel written with a purpose,
of which never for an instant does the author lose sight, it is yet absorbing in its
interest. It reveals the narrow motives and the intrinsic selfishness of certain
grades of social life; the corruption of business methods; the 'false, fairy gold,'
of fashionable charities, and 'advanced' thought. Margaret Wentworth is a
typical New England girl, reflective, absorbed, full of passionate and repressed
intensity under a quiet and apparently cold exterior. The events that group
themselves about her life are the natural result of such a character brought into
contact with real life. The book cannot be too widely read.&quot;&mdash;<i>Boston Traveller.</i></p>

<p>&quot;If the 'What-to-do Club' was clever, this is decidedly more so. It is a powerful
story, and is evidently written in some degree, we cannot quite say how great
a degree, from fact. The personages of the story are very well drawn,&mdash;indeed,
'Amanda Briggs' is as good as anything American fiction has produced. We
fancy we could pencil on the margin the real names of at least half the characters.
It is a book for the wealthy to read that they may know something that is required
of them, because it does not ignore the difficulties in their way, and especially
does not overlook the differences which social standing puts between class and
class. It is a deeply interesting story considered as mere fiction, one of the best
which has lately appeared. We hope the authoress will go on in a path where
she has shown herself so capable.&quot;&mdash;<i>The Churchman.</i></p>

<p>&quot;In Mrs. Campbell's novel we have a work that is not to be judged by
ordinary standards. The story holds the reader's interest by its realistic pictures
of the local life around us, by its constant and progressive action, and by the
striking dramatic quality of scenes and incidents, described in a style clear, connected,
and harmonious. The novel-reader who is not taken up and made to
share the author's enthusiasm before getting half-way through the book must
possess a taste satiated and depraved by indulgence in exciting and sensational
fiction. The earnestness of the author's presentation of essentially great purposes
lends intensity to her narrative. Succeeding as she does in impressing us strongly
with her convictions, there is nothing of dogmatism in their preaching. But the
suggestiveness of every chapter is backed by pictures of real life.&quot;&mdash;<i>New York
World.</i></p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>The author writes earnestly and warmly, but without prejudice, and her volume
is an eloquent plea for the amelioration of the evils with which she deals. In the
present importance into which the labor question generally has loomed, this volume
is a timely and valuable contribution to its literature, and merits wide reading
and careful thought.&mdash;<i>Saturday Evening Gazette.</i></p>

<p>She has given us a most effective picture of the condition of New York working-women,
because she has brought to the study of the subject not only great care
but uncommon aptitude. She has made a close personal investigation, extending
apparently over a long time; she has had the penetration to search many queer
and dark corners which are not often thought of by similar explorers; and we
suspect that, unlike too many philanthropists, she has the faculty of winning confidence
and extracting the truth. She is sympathetic, but not a sentimentalist;
she appreciates exactness in facts and figures; she can see both sides of a question,
and she has abundant common sense.&mdash;<i>New York Tribune.</i></p>

<p>Helen Campbell's &quot;Prisoners of Poverty&quot; is a striking example of the trite
phrase that &quot;truth is stranger than fiction.&quot; It is a series of pictures of the lives
of women wage-workers in New York, based on the minutest personal inquiry and
observation. No work of fiction has ever presented more startling pictures, and,
indeed, if they occurred in a novel would at once be stamped as a figment of the
brain.... Altogether, Mrs. Campbell's book is a notable contribution to the labor
literature of the day, and will undoubtedly enlist sympathy for the cause of the oppressed
working-women whose stories do their own pleading.&mdash;<i>Springfield Union.</i></p>

<p>It is good to see a new book by Helen Campbell. She has written several
for the cause of working-women, and now comes her latest and best work, called
&quot;Prisoners of Poverty,&quot; on women wage-workers and their lives. It is compiled
from a series of papers written for the Sunday edition of a New York paper. The
author is well qualified to write on these topics, having personally investigated the
horrible situation of a vast army of working-women in New York,&mdash;a reflection of
the same conditions that exist in all large cities.</p>

<p>It is glad tidings to hear that at last a voice is raised for the woman side of these
great labor questions that are seething below the surface calm of society. And it
is well that one so eloquent and sympathetic as Helen Campbell has spoken in behalf
of the victims and against the horrors, the injustices, and the crimes that have
forced them into conditions of living&mdash;if it can be called living&mdash;that are worse than
death. It is painful to read of these terrors that exist so near our doors, but none
the less necessary, for no person of mind or heart can thrust this knowledge aside.
It is the first step towards a solution of the labor complications, some of which
have assumed foul shapes and colossal proportions, through ignorance, weakness,
and wickedness.&mdash;<i>Hartford Times.</i></p></blockquote>

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement

works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern

before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity

receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
